<h2 class="intro">FOREWORD</h2>

<p>The purpose of this series of stories is to show
the children, and even those who have already taken
up the study of history, the <i>home life</i> of the colonists
with whom they meet in their books. To this end
every effort has been made to avoid anything savoring
of romance, and to deal only with facts, so far
as that is possible, while describing the daily life
of those people who conquered the wilderness whether
for conscience sake or for gain.</p>

<p>That the stories may appeal more directly to the
children, they are told from the viewpoint of a child,
and purport to have been related by a child. Should
any criticism be made regarding the seeming neglect
to mention important historical facts, the answer
would be that these books are not sent out as
histories,&mdash;although it is believed that they will awaken
a desire to learn more of the building of the nation,&mdash;and
only such incidents as would be particularly
noted by a child are used.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span></p>

<p>Surely it is entertaining as well as instructive for
young people to read of the toil and privations in
the homes of those who came into a new world to
build up a country for themselves, and such homely
facts are not to be found in the real histories of
our land.</p>

<h2 class="chap1">A PROPER BEGINNING</h2>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-009.jpg" width="194" height="320" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Truly it seems a great undertaking to journey from
London into the land of America, yet I have done so,
and because of there being
very few girls only twelve
years of age who are likely to
make such a voyage, it seems
to me well if I set down those
things which I saw and did
that might be interesting to
myself in the future, when I
shall have grown to be an old
lady, if God permits, or to
any other who may come upon
this diary.</p>

<p>Of course I must first set
down who I am, in case strangers should some day
chance to find this book, and, growing interested in
it&mdash;for who can say that I may not be able to tell a
story which shall be entertaining, because of there being
in it much which the people of England have never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
seen&mdash;give me credit for having written a diary without
a proper beginning.</p>

<p>You must know, then, that my name is Ruth. In the
year of our Lord, 1630, when, as I have said, I was but
twelve years of age, my father joined that company led
by Master John Winthrop, whose intent it was to go into
America to spread the gospel, and there also build up a
town wherein should live only those who were one with
them in the worship of God.</p>

<p>This company was made up of four classes of people.
First there were those who paid a sum of money for
their passage to America, and, because of having done
so, were to be given a certain number of acres of land
in the New World.</p>

<p>In the second class were those who, not having
enough money to pay the full price for their passage,
agreed to perform a sufficient amount of work, after
arriving in America, to make up for the same.</p>

<p>In the third class were those called indentured servants,
which is much the same as if I said apprentices.</p>

<p>The fourth and last class had in it those people who
were to work for wages, at whatsoever trade or calling
they were best fitted.</p>

<p>It needs not that I should say more by way of a
beginning, for surely all the people in England, if they
do not know it now, will soon come to understand why
we, together with those who have gone before us, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
the companies that are to come after, have journeyed
into America.</p>

<h2>ON THE BROAD OCEAN</h2>

<p>It was decided that my parents, and, of course,
myself, should sail in the same ship with Master Winthrop,
and the name of that vessel was the <i>Arabella</i>, she
having been so called in honor of Lady Arabella
Johnson, who journeyed with us.</p>

<p>My mother was sadly grieved because of Mistress
Winthrop's deciding not to go on the voyage with her
husband, but to join him in the New World later, and
this decision was a disappointment to very many of
the company. I am in doubt as to whether the Lady
Arabella would have gone with us on this ship, had
she not believed Mistress Winthrop also was to go.</p>

<p>It was on the twenty-second day of March, in that
year which I have previously set down, that, having
already journeyed from London to Southampton,
we went aboard the <i>Arabella</i>, counting that the
voyage would be begun without delay, and yet, because
of unfriendly winds and cruel storms, our ship,
with three others of the company, lay at anchor until
the eighth day of April.</p>

<p>Then it was, after the captain of the ship had shot
off three guns as a farewell, that we sailed out on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
broad ocean, where we
were tossed by the waves
and buffeted by the
winds for nine long,
dreary weeks.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-012.jpg" width="255" height="347" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Had it not been for
Master Winthrop's discourses
day after day,
we should have been
more gloomy than we
were; but with such a
devout man to remind
us of the mercy and
goodness of God, it
would have been little short of a sin had we repined
because of not being carried more speedily to that land
where was to be our home.</p>

<p>There was one day during the voyage, when it seemed
verily as if the Lord was not minded we should journey
away from England.</p>

<p>We had not been out from the port many days, when
on a certain morning eight ships were seen behind us,
coming up as if counting to learn what we were like;
and then it was that all the men of the company believed
these were Spanish vessels bent on taking us
prisoners, for, as you know, at that time England was
at war with Spain.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span></p>

<p>It was most fearsome to all the children, but very
much so to Susan, a girl very nearly my own age, with
whom I made friends after coming aboard, and myself.</p>

<h2>MAKING READY FOR BATTLE</h2>

<p>When Susan and I saw the men taking down the
hammocks from that portion of the vessel which was
called the gun deck,
loading the cannon,
and bringing out the
powder-chests, truly
were we alarmed.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-013.jpg" width="258" height="357" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Standing clasped
in each other's arms,
unheeded by our elders,
all of whom were
in a painful state of
anxiety or fear, we
watched intently all
that forenoon the ships
which we believed belonged
to the enemy.</p>

<p>Then I heard one of the sailors say that the Spaniards
were surely gaining on us, and the captain of the vessel,
as well as Master Winthrop and my father, must have believed
it true, for all preparations were made for a battle.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span></p>

<p>The small cabins, leading from the great one, were
torn down that cannon might be used without hindrance,
and the bedding, and all things that were likely
to take fire, were thrown overboard. The boats were
launched into the sea and towed alongside the ship so
that when the worst came we might fly in them, and
then that which was most fearsome of all, the women
and children were sent down into the very middle of
the vessel, where they might not be in danger when
the Spaniards began to send iron balls among us,
as it seemed certain they soon would.</p>

<p>While we were huddled together in the darkness,
many weeping, some moaning, and a few women,
among whom was my mother, silent in the agony of
grief, Master Winthrop came down to pray with us,
greatly to our comforting, after which, so I have been
told since, he went up among the men where he performed
the same office.</p>

<p>It was not until an hour after noon that our people
discovered that those ships which we believed to be
Spanish, were English vessels, from which we had nothing
to fear.</p>

<p>Then word was sent down to us in that dark place
that we might come up above, and once in the sunlight
again, we found all the passengers rejoicing and making
merry over the fears which had so lately beset them.</p>

<p>How bright the sun looked to Susan and me as we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
stood near the rail of our ship, gazing at the vessels
which only a few hours before were a fearsome sight,
but now seemed so friendly! It was as if we had been
very near to death, and were suddenly come into a place
of safety.</p>

<h2>THE REST OF THE VOYAGE</h2>

<p>From that time until St. George's Day, which you
all know is the twenty-third of April, nothing happened
deserving of being set down here. Then it was, however,
that during the forenoon the captain moved our
sails so that the ship would remain idle upon the waters,
which is what sailors call "heaving to," and the captains
of the other vessels, together with Master Pynchon
and many more gentlemen, came on board for a feast.</p>

<p>Lady Arabella and the gentlewomen of our company
had dinner in the great cabin, while the gentlemen
partook of their good cheer in the roundhouse, as the
sailors call it, which is a sort of cabin on the hindermost
part of the quarter-deck.</p>

<p>By four o'clock in the afternoon the feast was at an
end; the gentlemen who had come to visit us went on
board their own ships, and again were the vessels
headed for that country of America in which we counted
to spend the remainder of our lives.</p>

<p>Susan and I were much together during this voyage,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
for neither of us made very friendly with the other
children, and I do not remember that anything of import
happened until we were come, so the captain said,
near to the New World.</p>

<p>It is not needed I should set down that again and
again were there furious storms, when it seemed certain
our ship would be sunk, for there was so much of
such disagreeable weather during the nine weeks of
voyaging, that if I were to make a record of each unpleasant
day, this diary would be filled with little else.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-016.jpg" width="222" height="386" alt="" />
</div>

<p>I have set down, however, that on the seventh day of
June, which was Monday, we had come, so Master
Winthrop said, off "the
Banks," where was good
fishing to be found; but
why this particular spot on
the ocean should be called
the Banks, neither Susan
nor I could understand.
The waves were much like
those we had seen from day
to day; but yet, in some
way, the captain knew that
we had come to the place
where it would be possible
to take fish in great numbers,
and so we did.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<p>It is not seemly a young girl should set down the fact,
with much of satisfaction, that she enjoyed unduly the
food before her, and yet I must confess that those fish
tasted most delicious after we had been feeding upon
pickled pork, or pickled beef, with never anything
fresh to take from one's mouth the flavor of salt.</p>

<p>It was a feast, as Susan and I looked at the matter,
far exceeding that which we had on St. George's Day,
and surely more enjoyable to us, for what can be better
pleasing to the mouth than a slice of fresh codfish, fried
until it is so brown as to be almost beautiful, after one
has had nothing save that which is pickled?</p>

<h2>THE FIRST VIEW OF AMERICA</h2>

<p>Five days later, which is the same as if I said on
the twelfth day of June, early in the morning, when
Susan and I came on deck, we saw spread out before us
the land, and it needed not we should ask if this was
the America where we were to live, for all the people
roundabout us were talking excitedly of the skill which
had been displayed by the master of the <i>Arabella</i>, in
thus bringing us directly to the place where we had
counted on coming.</p>

<p>It can well be fancied that Susan and I overhung the
rail as the ship sailed nearer and nearer to the land,
watching intently everything before us; yet seeing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
much to our surprise, little more than would have been
seen had we come upon the coast of England.</p>

<p>I had foolishly believed that even the shores of this
New World would be unlike anything to be found elsewhere,
and yet they were much the same. The rocks
rising high above the waters, with the waves beating
against them, made up a picture such as we had before
us even while we lay at anchor off Cowes. The trees
were like unto the trees in our own land, and the grass
was of no different color. Save that all this before us
was a wilderness, we might have been off the coast of
Cornwall.</p>

<p>I have said it was all the same, and yet because of the
fears and the anxieties regarding the future, was it
different.</p>

<p>This was the land to which we had come for the
making of a new home; the place where our parents had
pledged themselves to spread the gospel as the Lord
would have it spread.</p>

<p>We knew, because of what had been written by our
friends who had journeyed to this new world before us
that here we were to find brown savages, many of whom,
like wild beasts, would thirst to shed our blood. Here
also could we expect to see fierce animals, such as might
not be met with elsewhere in the world; and, in the way
of blessings, we should meet those friends of ours who,
for conscience sake and for the will to do God's bidding,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
had come to prepare the land that it should be more
friendly toward us.</p>

<h2>THE TOWN OF SALEM</h2>

<p>I had not yet been able to discover any of the dwellings
which marked the town of Naumkeag, or Salem,
when all the cannon on board our vessel were set off
with a great noise. Then, as we came around a point
of land, there appeared before our eyes a goodly ship
lying at anchor, and beyond her the town that was&mdash;much
to my disappointment, for I had fancied something
grander&mdash;made up of a few log houses which
seemed rather to be quarters for servants than
dwellings for gentlemen's families, although we had
been told that the habitations would be rude indeed.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-019.jpg" width="456" height="222" alt="" />
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span></p>

<p>A boat was put into the water from our ship, and as
the sailors rowed toward the vessel which was at
anchor, I heard my father say to my mother that they
were going in quest of Master William Pierce, a London
friend of ours.</p>

<p>As we watched, I asked that question which had
come often in my mind during the voyage, which was,
why this new town that Master Endicott had built
should have two names.</p>

<p>Mother told me that the Indians had called the place
Naumkeag, and so also did those men who first settled
here; but when some of our people came, and gathered
around them several from the Plymouth Colony, together
with a number of planters who had built themselves
homes along the shore, it was decided to name the new
town Salem, which means peace, for here it was they
hoped to gain that peace which should be on this earth
like unto the peace we read of in the Book, which
passeth all understanding.</p>

<p>And now before I set down that which we saw,
and while you are picturing our company on the
deck of the <i>Arabella</i> looking shoreward, impatient
to set their feet once more on the earth, let me
tell you what I had heard, since we left England;
regarding this town of peace, and those of our people,
or of other faiths, who settled here two years or
more ago.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span></p>

<h2>OTHER VILLAGES</h2>

<p>Master Endicott, who was of our faith, had come to
these shores in March of the year 1628, with a company
of thirty or forty people, and, finding other men
living at the head of this harbor which the <i>Arabella</i> had
entered after her long voyage, decided to build his
home at this place.</p>

<p>In the next year, Master Higginson, coming over
with six vessels in which were eighteen women, twenty-six
children, and three hundred men, joined the little
colony. These last brought with them one hundred
and forty head of cattle, and forty goats.</p>

<p>However, only two hundred of this last company
remained at Salem, the others having chosen to build
for themselves a new town, which they called Charlestown,
on that large body of water which is set down
on the maps as Massachusetts Bay.</p>

<p>In addition to these two villages, it was said that
there were five or six houses at the place called Nantasket;
that one Master Samuel Maverick was living on
Noddles Island, and one Master William Blackstone
on the Shawmut Peninsula.</p>

<p>I have set this down to the end that those who read it
may understand we were not come into a wild country,
in which lived none but savages, and I must also add
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
that not so many miles away was the town of Plymouth,
where had been living, during ten years, a company of
Englishmen who had worked bravely to make for
themselves a home.</p>

<p>And now since I am done with explaining, and since
the boat which put out from our vessel and which I
left you watching, has come back from that other ship,
bringing Master William Pierce, let me tell you what
we did on the first day in this new world.</p>

<h2>VISITING SALEM</h2>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-022.jpg" width="288" height="373" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The gentlemen
and ladies of our
company were invited
on shore to a
feast of deer meat,
while the servant
women and maids
were allowed to
land on the other
side of the harbor,
where they feasted
themselves on wild
strawberries, which
were exceeding
large and sweet.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span></p>

<p>It would be untrue for me to say that deer meat made
into a huge pie is not inviting, because of my having
enjoyed it greatly, and yet I could not give so much
attention to the dainty as I would have done at almost
any other time, so intent was I upon seeing this village
concerning which Master Endicott had written so many
words of praise.</p>

<p>Had Susan and I come upon it within an hour after
leaving the city of London, it would have looked exceedingly
poor and mean; but now, when we were on
the land after a voyage of nine long weeks, verily it
seemed like a wondrous pleasant place in which to live.</p>

<p>More than an hundred dwellings, so my father said,
had been built. Some were of logs laid one on top of
the other in a clumsy fashion, with the places where
windows of glass should have been, covered with oiled
paper, and doors that were so cumbersome and heavy
it was a real task for Susan and me to open and close
them, but yet they had a homely look.</p>

<p>Then there were what might be called sheds, made
of logs, or the bark of trees, and, in two cases, dwellings
of branches laid up loosely as a child would build a toy
camp.</p>

<p>It was as if each man had built according to his inclination
and willingness to labor, the more thrifty
having log dwellings, and the indolent ones rude huts.</p>

<p>Even Susan and I could understand that whosoever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
had decided upon the places where these homes should be
built, had in mind the making of a large town; for paths,
like unto streets, led here and there, while all around
grew trees, not thickly, to be sure, but yet in such
abundance as to show that all this had lately been a
wilderness.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-024.jpg" width="463" height="259" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Even in these streets had been left the stumps of
trees after the trunks were removed, which served to
give an untidy look to the whole, making it seem as if
one were in a place where had been built shelters only
for a little time, and which would shortly be abandoned.</p>

<p>The welcome which was given us, however, was even
warmer than we would have received at home in England,
and little wonder that these gentlefolk whom we
had known there, should be overjoyed to see us here.</p>

<p>Both Susan and I came to understand, not many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
months afterward, how great can be the pleasure one
has at seeing old friends whom he had feared never
to meet again in this world.</p>

<p>It was a veritable feast which these good people of
Salem set before us, and yet so strange was the cookery,
that I am minded to describe later some of the dishes
at risk of dwelling overly long upon matters of no importance.</p>

<h2>MAKING COMPARISONS</h2>

<p>Master Winthrop said, when we were going on board
the ship again, that although it was nothing but peas,
pudding, and fish, quite coarse as compared with what
we would have had at home in England, save as to the
venison pie, it all seemed sweet and wholesome to him.</p>

<p>When the day was come to an end, we went into the
ship once more, for there were not spare beds enough
in all the town to serve for half our party, and you may
be very certain that once we were gathered again in the
great cabin, all talked eagerly concerning what had
been done; at least our parents did, for it would have
been unseemly in us children to interrupt while our
elders were talking.</p>

<p>Mother was not well satisfied with the houses, believing
it would be possible to make dwellings more
like those we left behind; but father bade her have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
patience, saying that a shelter from the weather was
the first matter to be thought of, and that the pleasing
of the eye could well come later, after we had more
with which to work.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-026.jpg" width="458" height="317" alt="" />
</div>

<p>She, thinking as was I at the moment, of the floor in
the house where we ate the venison pie, declared stoutly
that there would be no more of labor in laying down
planks, at least in the living-room, than in beating
the earth hard, as it seemingly had been where we
visited.</p>

<p>Then, laughingly, he bade her rest content, nor set
her mind so strongly upon the vanities of this world,
saying that if God permitted him to raise a roof, so
that his wife and child might be sheltered from the sun
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
and from the rain, he would be satisfied, even though
the legs of his table stood upon the bare earth.</p>

<p>It was this conversation between my parents that
caused the other women to talk of how they would have
a home built, until Lady Arabella put an end to what
was almost wrangling,&mdash;for each insisted that her plan
for a dwelling in this New World was the best,&mdash;by
saying that whatsoever God willed we should have,
and that it would be more than we deserved.</p>

<h2>AN INDIAN GUEST AND OTHER VISITORS</h2>

<p>Both Susan and I had gazed about us eagerly when
we went on shore, hoping to see a savage. We were not
bent on meeting him near at hand, where he might do
us a mischief; but had the desire that a brown man
might go past at a distance, and we were grievously
disappointed at coming aboard the ship again without
having seen one.</p>

<p>Therefore it is that you can well fancy how surprised
and delighted we were next morning when,
on going on deck just after breakfast to have another
look at this new town, whom should we see walking to
and fro on the quarter-deck with Master Winthrop, as
if he had been one of the first gentlemen of the land,
but a real Indian!</p>

<p>There were the feathers, of which we had heard,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
encircling his head and ending in a long train behind.
His skin was brown, or, perhaps, more the color of
dulled copper. He wore a mantle of fur, with the
skin tanned soft as cloth,
and that which father said
was deer hide cunningly
treated until it was like to
flannel, had been fashioned
into a garment which answered
in the stead of a
doublet.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-028.jpg" width="215" height="386" alt="" />
</div>

<p>I cannot describe his
appearance better than by
saying it would not have
surprised me, had I been
told that one of our own people
had painted and dressed
himself in this fanciful fashion
to take part in some
revel, for truly, save in regard to the color of his skin,
he was not unlike the gentlemen who were on the ship.</p>

<p>As Susan and I learned later, he was the king, or
chief man, among those Indians who called themselves
Agawams. Father said he was the sagamore, which,
as I understand it, means that he was at the head of
his people, and his name was Masconomo.</p>

<p>A very kindly savage was he, and in no wise bloodthirsty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
looking as I had expected. He was a friend of
Master Endicott as well as of all those who lived with
him in this town of Salem, and had come to welcome
our people to the new world, which, as it seemed to
both Susan and me, was very thoughtful in one who
was nothing less than a heathen.</p>

<p>The Indian sagamore stayed on board the ship all day,
and our company, together with the people of Salem,
were as careful to make him welcome as if he had been
King James himself.</p>

<p>The reason for this, as father afterward explained
to me, was because of its being of great importance
that we make friends with the savages, else the time
might come when they would set about taking our
lives, being in far greater numbers than the white
men.</p>

<p>Neither Susan nor I could believe that there was
any danger that these people with brown skins would
ever want to do us harm. Surely they must be pleased,
we thought, at knowing we were willing to live among
them, and, besides, if all the savages were as mild looking
as this Masconomo, they would never be wicked enough
to commit the awful crime of murder.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-030.jpg" width="294" height="328" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In the evening, after the Indian went ashore,
the good people of Salem came on board in great
numbers, and, seeing that it was a time when he
might do good to their souls, Master Winthrop gathered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
us on deck, where
he talked in a godly
strain not less than
an hour and a half.</p>

<p>It was indeed
wicked of Susan to
say that she would
have been better
pleased had we
been allowed to
chat with the people
concerning this
new land, rather
than listen to Master Winthrop, who, so mother says, is a
most gifted preacher even though that is not his calling,
yet way down in the bottom of my heart I felt much as
did Susan, although, fortunately, I was not tempted
to give words to the thought.</p>

<h2>A CHRISTENING AND A DINNER</h2>

<p>When another day came, we girls had a most delightful
time, for there was to be a baby baptized in the
house of logs where are held the meetings, and Mistress
White, one of the gentlefolks who came here with the
company of Master Higginson, was to give a dinner
because of her young son's having lived to be christened.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span></p>

<p>To both these festivals Susan and I were bidden, and
it surprised me not a little to see so much of gaiety in
this New World, where I had supposed every one went
around in fear and trembling lest the savages should
come to take their lives.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-031.jpg" width="258" height="365" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The christening was attended to first, as a matter
of course, and, because of his having so lately arrived
from England, Master Winthrop was called upon to
speak to the people, which he did at great length.
Although the baby,
in stiff dress and mittens
of linen, with his
cap of cotton wadded
thickly with wool,
must have been very
uncomfortable on account
of the heat, he
made but little outcry
during all this ceremony,
or even when
Master Higginson
prayed a very long
time.</p>

<p>We were not above
two hours in the meetinghouse, and then went to the
home of Mistress White, getting there just as she came
down from the loft with her young son in her arms.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span></p>

<p>Mother was quite shocked because of the baby's
having nothing in his hands, and while she is not given
to placing undue weight in beliefs which savor of
heathenism, declares that she never knew any good
to come of taking a child up or down in the house
without having first placed silver or gold between his
fingers.</p>

<p>Of course it is not so venturesome to bring a child
down stairs empty-handed; but to take him back for
the first time without something of value in his little
fist, is the same as saying that he will never rise in the
world to the gathering of wealth.</p>

<p>The dinner was much enjoyed by both Susan and me,
even though the baby, who seemed to be frightened
because of seeing so many strange faces, cried a goodly
part of the time.</p>

<p>We had wild turkey roasted, and it was as pleasing a
morsel as ever I put in my mouth. Then there was a
huge pie of deer meat, with baked and fried fish in
abundance, and lobsters so large that there was not a
trencher bowl on the board big enough to hold a whole
one. We had whitpot, yokhegg, suquatash, and many
other Indian dishes, the making of which shall be explained
as soon as I have learned the methods.</p>

<p>It was a most enjoyable feast, and the good people
of Salem were so friendly that when we went on board
ship that night, Susan and I were emboldened to say
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
to my father, that we should be rejoiced when the time
arrived for our company to build houses.</p>

<h2>DECIDING UPON A HOME</h2>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-033.jpg" width="267" height="437" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Then we learned for the first time that it had not
been the plan of our people to settle in this pleasant
place. It was not to the mind of Governor Winthrop,
nor yet in accord with the belief of our people in England,
that all of us who were to form what would be
known as the Massachusetts
Bay Colony,
should build our
homes in one spot.</p>

<p>Therefore it was
that our people,
meaning the elders
among the men, set
off through the forest
to search for a spot
where should be made
a new town, and we
children were allowed
to roam around the
village of Salem at
will, many of us,
among whom were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
Susan and I, often spending the night in the houses
of those people who were so well off in this world's
goods as to have more than one bed.</p>

<p>Lady Arabella Johnson and her husband had gone on
shore to live the second day after we arrived, for my
lady was far from well when she left England, and the
voyage across the ocean had not been of benefit to
her.</p>

<p>Our fathers were not absent above three days in the
search for a place to make our homes, and then Sarah
and I were told that it had been decided we should
live at Charlestown, where, as I have already told you,
a year before our coming, Master Endicott had sent
a company of fifty to build houses.</p>

<p>It pleased me to know that we were not going directly
into the wilderness, as both Susan and I had feared;
but that we should be able to find shelter with the people
who had already settled there, until our own houses
could be built.</p>

<p>It appeared that all the men of our company were
not of Governor Winthrop's opinion, regarding the place
for a home. Some of them, discontented with the
town of Charles, went further afoot, deciding to settle
on the banks of a river called the Mystic, while yet
others crossed over that point of land opposite where
we were to live, and found a pleasing place which they
had already named Rocksbury.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span></p>

<h2>A SAD LOSS</h2>

<p>Susan and I believed, on the night our fathers came
back from their journey, that we would set off in the
ship to this village of Charlestown without delay, and
so we might have done but for my Lady Arabella, who
was taken suddenly worse of her sickness; therefore
it was decided to wait until she had gained her health.</p>

<p>But alas! the poor lady had come to this New World
only to die, and it was a sad time indeed for Susan and
me when the word was brought aboard ship that she
had gone out from among us forever.</p>

<p>We had learned during the voyage to love her very
dearly, and it seemed even more of a blow for God to
take her from us in this wilderness, than if she had
been at her home in England.</p>

<p>Although it is not right for me to say so, because,
of course, our fathers know best, yet would my heart
have been less sore if some word of farewell could have
been said when we laid my Lady Arabella in the grave
amid the thicket of fir trees.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-036.jpg" width="299" height="350" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Mother says, that she is but repeating the words
of Governor Winthrop, that it is wrong to say prayers
over the dead, or to utter words of grief or faith. Therefore
it was in silence we followed my lady in the coffin
made by the ship's carpenter, up the gentle slope to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
the thicket of firs, the bell of the <i>Arabella</i> tolling all the
while; and in silence we stood, while the body was being
covered with earth, little thinking how soon should we
be doing a like service for another who had come to
aid in building up a new nation.</p>

<p>On the day after we left my Lady Arabella on the
hillside, the ship <i>Talbot</i>, which was one of the vessels
that should have sailed in company with the <i>Arabella</i>,
arrived at Salem, and the grief which filled our hearts
for the dead, was
lightened somewhat
by the joy in
greeting the living
who were come to
join us.</p>

<h2>REJOICING TURNED
INTO MOURNING</h2>

<p>Governor Winthrop
was among
those who seemingly
had most
cause for rejoicing, because of his son Henry's having
arrived on the <i>Talbot</i>, bringing news of his mother
and of the remainder of the family.</p>

<p>Good Master Winthrop had so much of business to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
look after on this day, that he
could not spend many moments
in talking with his son, and
mayhap he will never
cease to regret that he
did not give his first attention
to the boy, for,
during the afternoon,
while his father was engaged
with public affairs,
Henry was moved by
curiosity to visit some
Indian wigwams which
could be seen a long distance
along the coast.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-037.jpg" width="249" height="393" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Not being of the mind to walk so far, he cast about
for a boat of some kind, and, seeing a canoe across the
creek, plunged into the water to swim over that he
might get it.</p>

<p>Susan and I were watching the brave young man
when he sprang so boldly and confidently into the water,
never dreaming that harm might come to him, and
yet before he was one quarter way across the creek,
he suddenly flung up his arms with a stifled cry.
Then he sank from our sight, to be seen no more
alive.</p>

<p>He had been seized with a cramp, while swimming most-like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
because of having gone into the cold water heated,
so my father said, for the day was very warm;
but however that may be, eight and forty hours later
we walked, a mournful procession, up the hill, even as
we had done behind the earthly clay of Lady Arabella,
while the bells of the ships in the harbor tolled most
dismally.</p>

<p>Verily Governor Winthrop's strength is in the Lord,
as my mother said, for although his heart must have
been near to bursting with grief, no one saw a sign of
sorrow on his face, so set and stern, as he stood there
listening to the clods of earth that were thrown upon
the box in which lay the body of his son.</p>

<p>Susan, who is overly given to superstition, I am afraid,
declared that it was an ill omen for us to have two
die when we had but just come into the new country,
and when I told her that it was wicked to place one's
faith in signs, she reminded me that I found fault
because of Mistress White's baby's being taken out of
the room for the first time with neither gold nor silver
in his hands.</p>

<h2>THANKSGIVING DAY IN JULY</h2>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-039.jpg" width="291" height="359" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The ship <i>Success</i>, which was also of our fleet, having
been left behind when we sailed from England, came
into the harbor on the sixth of July, and then it was,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
although our hearts were bowed down with grief because
of the death of Lady Arabella and the drowning
of Henry Winthrop, that our people decided we should
hold a service of thanksgiving to God because of His
having permitted all our company to arrive in safety.</p>

<p>Word was sent to the people of Charlestown, and to
those few men in the settlement which is called Dorchester,
that they might join with us in the service of
praise, and many came to Salem to hear the preaching
of Master Endicott,
Master Higginson,
and Governor Winthrop.</p>

<h2>LEAVING SALEM
FOR CHARLESTOWN</h2>

<p>Four days later,
which is the same
as if I said on the
twelfth of July, the
fleet of ships sailed
out of Salem harbor
with those of our people on board who could
not bear the fatigue of walking, to go up to the new
village of Charlestown.</p>

<p>Before night was come, we were at anchor off that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
place where we believed the remainder of our days on
this earth would be spent.</p>

<p>Because of the labor performed by those men whom
Master Endicott had sent to this place a year before,
there were five or six log houses which could be used
by some of our people, and the governor's dwelling,
which of course would be the most lofty in the town,
was partially set up; yet the greater number of us did
not go on shore immediately to live.</p>

<p>Governor Winthrop remained on board the <i>Arabella</i>,
as did my parents and Susan's, and now because there
is little of interest to set down regarding the building of
the village, am I minded to tell that which I heard our
fathers talking about evening after evening, as we sat in
the great cabin when the day's work was done.</p>

<p>To you who have never gone into the wilderness to
make a home, the anxiety which people in our condition
felt concerning their neighbors cannot be understood.
To us, if all we heard regarding what the savages might
do against us was true, it was of the greatest importance
we should know who were settled near at hand, if it
so came that we were driven out from our town.</p>

<h2>OUR NEIGHBORS</h2>

<p>Now you must know that many years before, which is
much the same as if I had said in the year of our Lord,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
1620, a number of English people who had been living
in Holland because of their consciences not permitting
them to worship God in a manner according to the
Church of England, came over
to this country, and built a
town which was called Plymouth.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-041.jpg" width="254" height="351" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This town was not far by
water from our settlement; indeed,
one might have sailed
there in a shallop, if he
were so minded, and, in
case the wind served
well, perform the voyage
between daylight
and sunset.</p>

<p>It was, as I have said,
settled ten years before
we came to this new world, and the inhabitants now
numbered about three hundred. There were sixty-eight
dwelling houses, a fort well built with wood, earth and
stone, and a fair watch tower. Entirely around the town
was a stout palisade, by which I mean a fence made of
logs that stand eight or ten feet above the surface, and
placed so closely together that an enemy may not make
his way between them, and in all respects was it a
goodly village, so my father declared.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span></p>

<p>Near the mouth of the Neponset river Sir Christopher
Gardner, who was not one of our friends in a religious
way, had settled with a small company, and farther
down the coast, many miles away, it was said were
three other villages; but none among them could
outshine Salem, either in numbers of people, or in
dwellings.</p>

<p>When we were on the shore in Charlestown, looking
straight out over the water toward the nearest land, we
could see, not above two miles away, three hills which
were standing close to each other, and Master Thomas
Graves, who had taken charge of the people that
first settled in the town of Charles, had named the
place Trimountain; but the Indians called it Shawmut.
There only one white man was living and his name
was Master William Blackstone, as I have already
told you.</p>

<p>It seemed to me a fairer land, because of the hills
and dales, than was our settlement, and yet it would
not have been seemly for me to say so much, after
our fathers and mothers had decided this was the place
where we were to live.</p>

<h2>GETTING SETTLED</h2>

<p>The days which followed our coming to Charlestown
were busy ones, even to us women folks, for there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
was much to be done
in taking the belongings
ashore, or in helping
our neighbors to
set to rights their new
dwellings.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-043.jpg" width="260" height="401" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The Great House,
in which Governor Winthrop
would live, was
finished first, and into
this were moved as
many of our people as
it would hold.</p>

<p>Then again, there
were others who, not
content with staying
on the <i>Arabella</i> after having remained on board
of her so long, put up huts like unto the wigwams
made by the Indians, which, while the weather continued
to be so warm, served fairly well as places in
which to live.</p>

<p>If I said that we made shift to get lodgings on shore
in whatsoever manner came most convenient for the
moment, I should only be stating the truth, for some
indeed were lodged in an exceeding odd and interesting
fashion.</p>

<p>Susan's father, going back some little distance from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
the Great House, cut away the trees in such a manner
as to leave four standing in the form of a square, and
from one to another
of these he nailed
small logs, topped
with a piece of sail
cloth that had been
brought on shore
from the <i>Talbot</i>, finishing
the sides with
branches of trees,
sticks, and even two
of his wife's best
bed quilts. Into this
queer home Susan went with her
mother, while my parents were
content to use one of the rooms in the Great House
until father could build for us a dwelling of logs.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-044.jpg" width="291" height="340" alt="" />
</div>

<h2>THE GREAT SICKNESS</h2>

<p>It seemed much as if Susan was in the right, when she
said that the deaths of Lady Arabella and Henry Winthrop
were ill omens, because no sooner had all our people
landed from the ships, or come up through the forest
from Salem, than a great sickness raged among us.</p>

<p>Many had been ill during the voyage with what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
Master Higginson called scurvy, which is a disease
that attacks people who have lived long on salted
food, and again many others took to their beds with a
sickness caused by the lack of pure, fresh water.</p>

<p>Our fathers had but just begun to build up this new
town when it was as if the hand of God had been laid
heavily upon us, for, so it was said, not more than one
out of every five of our people was able to perform any
work whatsoever.</p>

<p>Those were long, dismal, dreadful days, when at
each time of rising in the morning we learned that this
friend or that neighbor had gone out from among us,
and it seemed to Susan and me as if there were a constant
succession of funerals, with not even the tolling
of bells to mark the passage of a body from its poor
home to its last resting place on earth, for by this time
the ships had gone out of the harbor.</p>

<p>The graves on the side of the hill increased tenfold
faster than did the dwellings, and all of us, even the
children, felt that our only recourse now was to pray
God that He would remove the curse, for of a verity
did it seem as if one had been placed upon us.</p>

<p>Again and again did I hear men and women who had
ever been devout and regular in their attendance upon
the preaching, ask if we had not offended the Lord by
breaking off from the English church, or if we might not
have committed some sin in thus abandoning the land
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
of our birth, thinking to ourselves that we would build
up a new nation in the world.</p>

<p>Therefore it was that even Susan and I felt a certain
relief of mind, when Governor Winthrop set the
thirtieth day of July as a day of fasting and of prayer;
and in order that all the English people who had come
into this portion of the New World might unite with us
in begging God to remove the calamity from our midst,
word was sent even as far as Plymouth, asking that
every one meet on that day with words of devout
petition.</p>

<h2>MOVING THE TOWN</h2>

<p>I have no doubt, because of mother's having said so
again and again, that the good Lord heard our fervent
entreaties, although the
sickness was not removed
from among us
for near to six weeks.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-046.jpg" width="255" height="278" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Then it was that
Master William Blackstone
came across from
Trimountain, and told
Governor Winthrop it
was his belief we should
do more toward aiding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
ourselves than simply praying. He advised, because of
there being plenty of good water in Trimountain, that
we forsake this village of Charlestown, and go across
to the opposite shore.</p>

<p>I might set down many words, repeating what I heard
our fathers say concerning the wisdom of such a move,
and yet this story which I am telling would not be improved
thereby, for the day finally came when it was
decided that, even at the cost of building new dwellings,
we should take all our belongings across the water to the
cove, back of which was a small hill, and, yet further
behind, a circle of mountains.</p>

<p>The cove would make an agreeable harbor for our
boats; the hill straight behind it would serve as a location
for a fort, while here and there were pleasant
streams, or gushing springs, whereas in Charlestown
we had only the water of the river, or from the marsh.</p>

<p>That I may not weary you by much explaining, it
is best I say that on the seventeenth of September,
when the sun had risen, we gathered at the Great
House to pray that God would bless us in this which
was much the same as our second undertaking, for
without delay, and before night had come, we were to
go across the bay and make for ourselves other homes.</p>

<p>And now lest it seem as if I were telling the same
story twice, I will not set down anything concerning the
building of this second village, because of that which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
we did in Trimountain being the same as had been
done in Charlestown.</p>

<p>The Great House was taken apart and carried across
the water, as were also the dwellings of logs, and while
this was being done, the women and children stayed in
Charlestown, where Master Thomas Graves had made,
what seemed to Susan and me, odd rules and regulations.</p>

<h2>MASTER GRAVES PROHIBITS SWIMMING</h2>

<p>He had been placed in command of the settlement
by Master Endicott, and among his first acts was the
appointment of tithing men, one of whose duties it was
to prevent the boys from swimming in the water, as
some lads of our company speedily learned when they
would have enjoyed such sport.</p>

<p>They were arrested straightway, and but for the fact
of being strangers, who were not acquainted with the
rules of the settlement, would have been fined three
shillings each.</p>

<p>Susan and I had no desire to spend our time swimming,
even had it been seemly for girls so to do; but
during very warm days it would have pleased us much
to go down into the water, properly clad, in order to take
a bath. Therefore did we believe Master Graves had
done that which was almost cruel, and it surprised us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
no little when, later, our own fathers passed the same
law.</p>

<h2>ANNA FOSTER'S PARTY</h2>

<p>There were good friends of ours in England who
believed that we had come into a wilderness where was
to be found naught save savages and furious beasts,
and it would have surprised them greatly, I believe, if
they could have known how much of entertainment
could already be found.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-049.jpg" width="287" height="366" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It was while we were waiting in Charlestown for the
homes in Trimountain to be built, that Anna Foster,
whose father is one of the
tithing-men, invited all of us
young girls who had come
under Governor Winthrop's
charge, to spend an
evening with her,
and we had much
pleasure in playing
hunt the whistle and
thread the needle.</p>

<p>Anna was dressed
in a yellow coat with
black bib and apron,
and she had black
feathers on her head.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
She wore both garnet and jet beads, with a locket,
and no less than four rings. There was a black collar
around her neck, black mitts on her hands, and a
striped tucker and ruffles. Her shoes were of silk,
and one would have said that she was dressed for
some evening entertainment in London.</p>

<p>Neither Susan nor I wore our best, because of the
candles here being made from a kind of tallow stewed
out of bayberry plums, which give forth much
smoke, and mother was afraid this would soil our
clothing. We were also told that because of there not
being candles enough, some parts of the house would be
lighted with candle-wood, which last is taken from the
pitch pine tree, and fastened to the walls with nails. This
wood gives forth a fairly good light; but there drops
from it so much of a black, greasy substance, that
whosoever by accident should stand beneath these
flames would be in danger of receiving a most disagreeable
shower.</p>

<p>This entertainment was not the only one which
was made for our pleasure while we remained in
Charlestown; but because of the sickness everywhere
around, very little in the way of merrymaking was
indulged in, and it seemed almost a sin for us to
be thus light-hearted while so many were in sore
distress.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<h2>THE TOWN OF BOSTON</h2>

<p>The first thing which was done by the governor and
his advisors, after we had moved from Charlestown,
was to change the name of Trimountain to that of
Boston.</p>

<p>As you must remember, Boston in England was near
to the home of Captain John Smith, who explored so
much of this New World and planted in Jamestown a
prosperous settlement. It was also in Boston that the
Lady Arabella, and the preacher, John Cotton, who had
promised to come here to us, had lived; therefore did it
seem as if such were the proper name for a town which
we hoped would one day, God willing, grow to be a
city.</p>

<p>It is true our new village is built in a rocky place,
where are many hollows and swamps, and it is almost
an island, because the neck of land which leads from it
to the main shore, is so narrow that very often does the
tide wash completely over it; but yet, after that time
of suffering in Charlestown, it seems to us a goodly
spot.</p>

<p>Our dwellings, except the Great House, are made of
logs, and the roofs thatched with dried marsh-grass, or
with the bark of trees. That each man shall have so
much of this thatching as he may need, the governor and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
chief men of the village have set aside a certain portion
of the salt marsh nearby, where any one may go to
reap that which is needed for his own dwelling; but no
more.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-052.jpg" width="458" height="286" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In time to come, so father says, we shall have chimneys
built of brick or stone, for when our settlement is
older grown some of the people will, in order to gain a
livelihood, set about making bricks, and already has
Governor Winthrop sent out men to search for limestone
so we may get mortar. But until that time shall
come, we have on the outside of our houses what are
called chimneys, which are made of logs plastered with
clay, or of woven reeds besmeared both as to the outside
and the inside with mud, until they are five or six
inches thick.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span></p>

<h2>GUARDING AGAINST FIRES</h2>

<p>It needs not for me to say that these chimneys are
most unsafe, for during our first winter in this new
town of Boston, hardly a week passed but that one or
another caught fire; and among the first laws which our
people passed was one providing for the appointment
of firewardens, who should have the right, and be
obliged, to visit every kitchen, looking up into the
chimneys to see if peradventure the plastering of clay
had been burned away.</p>

<p>Because of the number of these fires, and the likelihood
that they would continue to visit us frequently,
another law was made, obliging every man who owned
a dwelling of logs to keep a ladder standing nearby, so
that it might be easy to get at the thatched roof if the
flames fastened upon it; and, as soon as might be,
iron hooks with large handles were made to be hung
on the outside of the buildings, for the purpose of
tearing off the thatch when it was burning.</p>

<p>It has also been decided that when we have a church,
as we count on within a year, a goodly supply of ladders
and buckets shall be kept therein for the use of the entire
town, and then, when a fire springs out, our people
will know where to go for tools with which to fight
against it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span></p>

<h2>OUR OWN NEW HOME</h2>

<p>It must not be supposed that because of our dwellings
being unsightly on the outside, they are rough within,
for such is not the case. Many of the settlers, as did
father, brought over glass for the windows, therefore
we are not forced to put up with oiled paper, as are a
great many people living in this New World.</p>

<p>It was partly the dampness inside our homes, so
Governor Winthrop believed, which caused the sickness
in Charlestown, and therefore it was that my father
insisted we should have a floor of wood, instead of
striving to get along with bare ground which had been
beaten hard. Our floor is made of planks, roughly
hewn, it is true, but nevertheless it serves to keep our
feet from the ground. We have on the door real iron
hinges, instead of leather, or the skins of animals, as we
saw in Salem.</p>

<p>Save for the roughness of the floor and the walls,
the inside of my father's house is much the same as we
had in England, for he, like all of Governor Winthrop's
company who were able to do so, brought over the
furnishings of the old home, and while some of the
things look sadly out of place here, they provide us
with a certain comfort which would have passed unheeded
in the other country, because there we were not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
much better off in this world's goods than were our
neighbors.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-055.jpg" width="436" height="371" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Here, when I see a table made only of rough boards
spread upon trestles, I can get much pleasure out of
the knowledge that we brought with us those tables
which we had been using in England, and, when our
dinner is spread, save for the difference in the food, I
can well fancy myself in the old home. We have our
ware of pewter and of copper, and our trencher bowls
are of the best that can be hewn from maple knots.</p>

<p>In order that the walls and crevices, filled with moss
and plastered over with clay, may not offend the eye,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
mother has put up all the hangings which she brought
with her, and these, with some skins my father bought
at Salem, hide entirely that which is so unsightly in
other dwellings.</p>

<p>Contrasting our home with many which we saw in
Salem, or in Charlestown, I am come to believe my
lines are truly cast in pleasant places, and I strive to be
thankful to God for having given me the father which
I have.</p>

<h2>THE FASHION OF THE DAY</h2>

<p>I am afraid it may be almost sinful for me so to set
my mind upon the garments which one wears, and yet
I cannot but contrast my father with some of the common
men in the village.</p>

<p>The ruff which he wears around his neck is always
well starched, clean, and stands out in beautiful proportions.
On his low, peaked shoes, mother ever has
fixed rosettes, or knots made of ribbon. His doublet,
which is gathered around the waist with a silken belt,
is slashed on the sleeves to show the snowy linen beneath.
His trunk hose, meaning those which reach
from his waist to his knees, are of the finest wool. His
stockings, when he is dressed to meet with the Council,
are of silk, while his mandilion, or cloak, is always of
silk or velvet.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-057.jpg" width="272" height="352" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Perhaps one may think such attire hardly befitting
a wild place like this, yet I know of nothing which
serves to set off a man's figure, making him seem
of importance in the world, better than that he be
clad with due regard to the
fashion of the day. Master Winthrop
would not present the
gentlemanly appearance which
he does if he wore,
as do the common
people here, a band,
or a flat collar with
cord and tassels,
breeches of leather,
and a leather girdle around
his waist. If he had, as do
they, heavy shoes with heels
of wood, or if his clothing were
fastened together with hooks and eyes, instead of silken
points, and if his hat were of leather, would we be
pleased to call him Governor?</p>

<p>My mother often says that it is unseemly in a child
like me to speak of the clothing worn by gentlemen,
and yet I have noticed often and again, that she is as
careful of my father's attire when he goes out of doors
as she was at home in England, where all gentlemen
were dressed becomingly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span></p>

<p>Verily one need not go abroad in tatters, or oddities,
simply because of having come into this New World,
where much of work is required, and he who cares for
his personal appearance, to my way of thinking, is to
be given due credit.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-058.jpg" width="157" height="353" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Surely so the Massachusetts Bay Company thought,
for they furnished to every man who came from England
to settle here, save it be those who could afford
such things for themselves, four pairs of shoes and the
same number of stockings; four shirts; two suits of
doublet, and hose of leather lined with oiled skin; a
woolen suit, lined with leather, together with four bands
and two handkerchiefs, a green cotton
waistcoat, two pairs of gloves,
a leather belt, a woolen cap and two
red knit caps, a mandilion lined
with cotton, and also an extra pair
of breeches. Of course such an
outfit was for the common people,
not the gentlefolk.</p>

<p>In our company, the boys are
clothed exactly as are their fathers,
and many of them present a most
attractive appearance, although my
mother would not think it proper
for me to say so, much less to put
it down in writing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span></p>

<h2>MY OWN WARDROBE</h2>

<p>It surely cannot be wrong for me to think of that
which I wear, for if the good Lord has given me a
comely body, why shall I not array it properly? Or
if it be wrong, why did my father buy for me those
things, a list of which I am here setting down, not
from vanity, but simply to show how kind were my
parents?</p>

<p>I had a cap ruffle and a tucker, the lace of which
cost five shillings a yard; eight pairs of white kid gloves,
with two pairs of colored gloves, two pairs of worsted
hose and three pairs of thread, a pair of laced silk
shoes, and a pair of morocco shoes, not to speak of
four pairs of plain Spanish shoes, or two pairs made of
calf-skin for every day use; a hoop coat and a mask to
wear when the wind blows too roughly, and a fan for
use when the sun is hot. Susan had two necklaces,
one of garnet and one of jet; but I had only garnets.
Then I have a girdle with a buckle of silver; a mantle
and coat of lutestring; a piece of calico to be made up
when mother has time; four yards of ribbon for knots
or bows, and one and one-half yards of best cambric.
All these were bought especially for me when we left
home, and surely it can be no sin that I take pride in
them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span></p>

<h2>MASTER JOHNSON'S DEATH</h2>

<p>It was shortly after coming to this town of Boston
that we heard of the death of Master Johnson, Lady
Arabella's husband. A friendly man was he, ever
ready with a kindly word for us children, and we would
have mourned his loss much more, but for knowing
that it pleased him right well to go out of this world of
sorrow, that he might join his wife in God's country.</p>

<p>Susan and I had hoped we should hear of no more
deaths among those we cared for, after having come
into this last place of abode, and the news of Master
Johnson's taking away caused her superstitious fears
to break out anew; but I reminded her that we were in
God's keeping, whatsoever might befall, and that for
us to look forward into the morrow, searching for evil,
was the same as an injustice to our Maker, who would
do toward us whatsoever seemed good in His sight.</p>

<p>As I look back now upon the time when our town
of Boston first came into being, I can understand how
well it is for us that we may not read the future. Had
we at that time, when the winter was coming on, known
how much of sorrow and of suffering was in store for us,
before the earth would be freed from its bonds of ice,
then I believe of a verity we must have given up in
despair.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<p>However, it is not for me to look ahead even in this
poor attempt at setting down what we did in the new
land. Rather let me go back to our home life, and tell
somewhat concerning the odd dishes which were frequently
set on our table.</p>

<h2>MANY NEW KINDS OF FOOD</h2>

<p>There is little need for me to say that we had lobsters
in abundance, and of such enormous size that one was
put to it to lift them. I have heard it said that twenty-pound
weight was
not unusual, and
whosoever might
could catch, in traps
made for the purpose,
all the lobsters
he would.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-061.jpg" width="281" height="186" alt="" />
</div>

<p>As for other fish,
I can not set down on one page of this paper,
the many kinds with which the housewife might
provide herself for a trifling sum of money. We
often had eels roasted, fried, or boiled, because of
father's being very fond of them, and mother sometimes
stuffed them with nutmegs and cloves, making a
dish which was not to my liking, for it was hot to the
tongue.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span></p>

<p>Some of the good wives in Salem had shown my
mother how to prepare nassaump, which those who
first came to Salem learned from the Indians how to
make: It is nothing but corn beaten into small pieces,
and boiled until soft, after which it is eaten hot, or cold,
with milk or butter.</p>

<p>Nookick is to my mind more of a dainty than a substantial
food, and yet father declares that on a very
small quantity of it, say three great spoonfuls a day, a
man may travel or work without loss of strength. It
is made by parching the Indian corn in hot ashes, and
then beating it to a powder. Save for the flavor lent
to it by the roasting, I can see no difference between
nookick, and the meal made from the ground corn.</p>

<p>Mother makes whitpot of oat meal, milk, sugar and
spice, which is much to my taste, although father declares
it is not unlike oatmeal porridge such as is eaten
in some parts of England; but it hardly seems to me
possible, because of one's not putting sugar and spice
into porridge.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-063.jpg" width="290" height="330" alt="" />
</div>

<p>We often have bread made of pumpkins boiled soft,
and mixed with the meal from Indian corn, and this
father much prefers to the bread of rye with the meal of
corn; but the manner of cooking pumpkins most to my
liking, is to cut them into small pieces, when they are
ripe, and stew during one whole day upon a gentle fire,
adding fresh bits of pumpkin as the mass softens. If
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
this be steamed enough, it will look much like unto
baked apples, and, dressed with a little vinegar and
ginger, is to me a most tempting rarity. But we do not
often have it upon the table because of so much labor
being needed to prepare it.</p>

<p>Yokhegg is a pudding of which I am exceedingly
fond, and yet it is made of meal from the same Indian
corn that supplies the people hereabout with so much of
their food. It is
boiled in milk and
chocolate, sweetened
to suit one's taste
after being put on
the table, and while to
English people, who
are not accustomed
to all the uses which
we make of this
wheat, it may not
sound especially inviting,
it most truly is
a toothsome dainty.</p>

<p>The cost of setting one's table here is not great as
compared with that in England, for we may get a quart
of milk by paying a penny, or a dozen fat pigeons, in
the season, for three pence, while father has more than
once bought wild turkeys, to the weight of thirty pounds,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
for two shillings, and wild geese are worth but eight
pence.</p>

<h2>THE SUPPLY OF FOOD</h2>

<p>The season had come when, if we had been in England,
the people would have been gathering the harvest;
but here we had none, having come so late in the year
that there was no time to plant, and, consequently, we
had no crops.</p>

<p>I had never before realized how necessary it is for
people that the earth shall yield in abundance; but I
came to know it now right well through hearing father,
as he talked with mother regarding the fears which the
chief men of the colony had concerning the supply of
food.</p>

<p>Of course, girls such as Susan and I would not have
been likely to learn anything of the kind, save that
matters had come to such a pass as made the situation
serious, in which case it was no more than natural we
should hear our parents talking about it.</p>

<p>It seems, from what I learned, that a portion of the
provisions brought from England were spoiled during
the voyage, and also, that many of our people had
taken with them no more than enough to sustain life
for a month or two, believing that in this New World
food of all kinds would be found in abundance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span></p>

<p>Then again, many had bartered provisions, which
they should have kept for the winter use, with the Indians
in exchange for beaver skins, thinking thereby to
make much money. So general had this traffic become,
that early in September the Governor gave strict
orders against it, and it was also ordered that no person
in the town be allowed to carry out therefrom
anything eatable.</p>

<p>But yet the store of food grew smaller and smaller,
for there were many mouths to feed, and it seemed as
if we children were more often hungry because of knowing
that there was little to be had.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-066.jpg" width="294" height="365" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Susan reminded me of what she was pleased to call
the "omen," when it was as if the first of our duties in
the New World had been to bury two members of the
company, and as the days wore on I began really to
believe it a sin to harbor such thoughts.</p>

<p>As it had been in Charlestown, so did it come to be
here in Boston, when the rains of autumn set in.</p>

<p>Many of the dwellings had not been built with due
regard to sheltering those who were to live therein, and
because of the dampness&mdash;although mother says it
was owing quite as well to the homesickness and gloom
which came upon us when the leaves in the forest
turned brown, and yellow, and golden in token of the
dying year&mdash;the people sickened.</p>

<p>However it was, much of sickness prevailed among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
us in Boston, until the time came when my father and
mother, to both of whom God had allowed good health,
were absent from
home day after
day, nursing those
of our neighbors
who were unable
to aid themselves.</p>

<h2>THE SAILING OF
THE "LYON"</h2>

<p>It seemed at this
time as if the Lord
had set His face
against the rearing
of a nation in this
new land, which he had given to the brown men for their
homes, and Susan and I were not the only ones who
came to believe we were offending Him in some way
by thus having come here.</p>

<p>Then Governor Winthrop caused it to be known
throughout the town that he had hired Captain
Pierce, of the ship <i>Lyon</i>, which was then in Salem
Harbor, to go with all haste to the nearest town in
England, there to get for us as much of food as could
be bought.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span></p>

<p>This news cheered the people somewhat, for now was
the season when the winds blew strong, and it was
believed the ship would have speedy passage. Indeed,
some of the women declared she must return
before the middle of October, and said so much concerning
such possibility, that in time they came to believe
it true. Therefore, when the month of October
had nearly passed, their disappointment was great, and
they were more despondent than at first.</p>

<h2>THE FAMINE</h2>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-067.jpg" width="293" height="363" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Each day saw
the store of provisions
in the town
grow smaller.
Every family husbanded
that which
could be eaten,
with greatest care,
putting no more on
the table than was
absolutely necessary
for a single
meal, and those
things which we
had considered dainties, were no longer prepared.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span></p>

<p>Then came the Angel of Death, and man after man,
woman after woman, laid themselves down to die, not
from being starved, but, so Governor Winthrop declared,
from having sickened through scurvy, which had
come upon them during the voyage, after which, falling
into discontent and giving way to home-sickness, they
no longer struggled to live.</p>

<p>Before October had come to an end, food was so
scarce in Boston that the poorer people had nothing
save acorns, clams, and mussels to eat. During the
summer it had seemed as if the sea were actually filled
with fish, and yet now, when every boat that could be
found in the town and nearby had been sent out, it was
difficult for our men to take even fifty pounds weight
in a day.</p>

<p>As Susan said, even the fish forsook us, as the clams
and mussels would have done had they legs or fins.</p>

<p>The fowls of the forest also appeared to have departed,
and by November the most any family could boast
of was meal boiled in salt and water. In more happy
days I would have turned up my nose at such food, and
yet now it was like unto some sweet morsel, for so
scanty had our store become that my mother would
cook for each meal no more than half as much as we
could have eaten.</p>

<p>I have heard father say that for a bushel of flour
which had been brought from England, he paid in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
those dark days fourteen shillings, and there was so little
of it even at such price, that mother saved what store we
had that it might be made into gruel, or something
dainty, which the sick could keep upon their stomachs.</p>

<h2>THE SEARCH FOR FOOD</h2>

<p>Then it was that our pinnace was made ready for a voyage,
and with five of the strongest men on board, was sent
along the coast to trade with those Indians who called
themselves Narragansetts, taking with them everything
in the way of trinkets which was in the general store,
or could be gathered up from among the housewives.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-069.jpg" width="461" height="379" alt="" />
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span></p>

<p>Great was our rejoicing, five days later, when the
men came back, bringing with them an hundred bushels
of Indian corn. This seemed like a large amount
of food, and yet, so many were the mouths to be fed
from it, it was, so father said, scarce enough to hold
life in our bodies three days, if so be it had been divided
equally among all.</p>

<p>Father told us that three men, who were of the
poorer people, had walked all the way from Boston
town to Plymouth; but even there, where a harvest had
been gathered, they could get no more than one half-bushel
of meal made from Indian corn.</p>

<p>It was a time of famine such as I pray God we may
never know again. In my home, until these dreary
days, there had been no scarcity of food, and yet again
and again did I save a crust of rye bread, thinking it a
dainty to be nibbled upon slowly so that I might have
longer the pleasure of eating.</p>

<h2>THE STARVATION TIME</h2>

<p>It was as if the ship <i>Lyon</i>, on whose return a few
weeks before we had counted so hopefully, was gone,
never to come back.</p>

<p>Even the children watched the direction of the
winds, saying on this day that it was a favoring one
if the <i>Lyon</i> were on her course for Boston, and on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
the morrow mourning because of the breeze being
against her.</p>

<p>Yet she came not, nor did we hear aught concerning
her, or any other from the world beyond us.</p>

<p>We were alone in what was much the same as a
wilderness, and all those around upon whom we had
counted to aid us in time of distress were in nearly the
same dismal straits as were we.</p>

<p>Even the Indians declared that they were hard
pressed for something to eat, and more than once did
they come in twos or in threes to beg from us who were
starving, something that could be eaten.</p>

<p>Susan and I, as we sat clasped in each other's arms
hungry, and pining for the home over-seas which we
had left, came to fancy that the famine which held
possession of the land was like unto some terrible
monster who hung above us as a cloud, settling slowly
but surely day after day, until the hour would come
when his terrible fangs would be securely fastened upon
us.</p>

<p>During the month of January the deaths through
scurvy, if that indeed were the cause, grew less; but
all believed that in the stead of being removed by
disease, our people were slowly perishing from starvation.</p>

<p>All the food in Boston was brought together, and
portioned out, so that no one, whether he had of money,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
or was penniless, should suffer more than another.
And yet again and again in the night have I
been awakened by the gnawing of hunger in my
stomach.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-072.jpg" width="465" height="342" alt="" />

</div>

<p>With the beginning of January, Governor Winthrop
appointed a day on which we should all fast and pray,
as if indeed we had been doing other than fasting
throughout the long, dreary winter. On this day
every man, woman, and child in Boston town was to
spend his or her time in praying to the Lord to deliver
us from our affliction.</p>

<p>We no longer hoped for the coming of the <i>Lyon</i>.
Surely she must have been destroyed by the tempest,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
otherwise had we seen her before this, for nearly five
months had gone by since she left Salem Harbor.</p>

<h2>A DAY TO BE REMEMBERED</h2>

<p>It was on the fifth day of February, which is the same
as if I had said Saturday, and the fast was to be kept
on the next Thursday. Susan had come to my home on
Friday night to sleep in my bed with me, so that we
might have such poor comfort as could be found
in each other's company when we were nigh to
starving.</p>

<p>She had awakened before the day dawned on this
Saturday morning, which will be remembered by me
so long as the Lord permits that I live, and moaned in
distress because of the desire for food, until I opened
my eyes, fretting because of not being allowed to
sleep yet longer, for while I slumbered the pangs of
hunger were not known.</p>

<p>Seeing me awake, Susan began to speak of the fast
day on the following Thursday, saying that if we had
no food whatsoever during the twenty-four hours, at a
time when we were so near to starvation, surely would
we die, and she was going back to what she called the
omens, which came to us shortly after we arrived,
when we were startled by a loud shouting in the street
next beyond, where could be had a view of the sea.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span></p>

<h2>THE COMING OF THE "LYON"</h2>

<p>Dimly, like one in a dream, for there was no thought
in my mind this might be a signal that our time of trial
was come to an end, I wondered how it was that any
in this famine-stricken Boston of ours could raise
their voices as if in joy, until I heard father cry out
from the living-room below:</p>

<p>"The <i>Lyon</i> has arrived! The <i>Lyon</i> has arrived!"</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-074.jpg" width="295" height="381" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It might be that I could give you, by the aid simply
of words, some faint idea of how we suffered during
the time of starvation,
of sickness,
and of death; but
it is impossible for
me to set down
that which shall
picture the heartfelt
rejoicings and
fervent thanksgiving
that were ours
at thus knowing we
were soon to have
enough with which
to drive death from
our doors.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span></p>

<p>It was a time of the wildest excitement. I hardly
know what Susan and I did or said on that day, save
that we dressed hurriedly, running down to the very
shore of the cove, finding there nearly every person in
Boston, and stood with the water lapping our feet as
we watched the oncoming of the ship which was bringing
relief.</p>

<p>Never before had I thought a vessel could be beautiful;
but I have not seen a fairer sight than was the
<i>Lyon</i> on that morning, and before night came, our
stomachs, which had been crying out in distress because
of lack of food, were groaning through being overly
well filled.</p>

<p>The time of famine had passed, at least for this
season, and it was as if the sick began to gain new life,
and health, and strength, simply through knowing
that we were no longer in such dire straits.</p>

<h2>ANOTHER THANKSGIVING DAY</h2>

<p>Governor Winthrop gave voice to his relief and pleasure
by ordering, even before the <i>Lyon</i> had come to
anchor, that the fast which had been appointed for
the next Thursday should be a day of thanksgiving
instead, and so we made it, with prayers all the more
fervent because of our stomachs being well filled, and
the fear of dying by starvation being put behind us.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span></p>

<p>The ship was loaded with such things as wheat,
peas, oatmeal, pickled beef and pork, cheese and
butter, and, with what my mother declared was of the
greatest value, lemon juice, which is said to be a remedy
for those who are suffering with scurvy.</p>

<p>It was not allowed that those who had money should
buy plentifully of this cargo; but it was paid for by the
town authorities, and divided equally among us all.</p>

<p>When the day for thanksgiving came, my mother
allowed me to have an unusually hearty breakfast, for,
she said, there was so much for which to be thankful,
and so many who would be present to give thanks, that
no one could say when we might be able to have
dinner.</p>

<p>It was well she was thus thoughtful, for one of the
preachers who came over with us, Master Wilson,
preached, while Governor Winthrop treated us to a
lecture, and Master Phillips was so blessed with the
spirit that he prayed a full hour.</p>

<p>Susan and I feared we would have yet more preaching,
for on the ship <i>Lyon</i> had come a young man whom
my father said was gifted, and Susan's father believed
he would make his influence felt among us. It
was Master Roger Williams, and I am ashamed to say
that I sat in fear and trembling lest Governor Winthrop
should call upon him for a sermon, after we had
already had much the same as two; but, fortunately,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
so it seemed to me, Master Williams did not raise his
voice during the service.</p>

<p>It was near to night before we were done with giving
thanks, and then at each home was held a feast.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-077.jpg" width="459" height="330" alt="" />
</div>

<p>During Governor Winthrop's lecture on this thanksgiving
day, he urged that all the people, children as well as
grown folks, should take this time of famine as a lesson,
reminding us that it would not be a long while before
we could hope to reap a harvest, and in the meantime
there was very much of labor to be performed.</p>

<p>He declared that even with the cargo of the <i>Lyon</i>, we
had not enough to satisfy our wants until crops could
be gathered; but it was certain other ships would come
to Boston during the summer, with more stores. Yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
because of its being possible we might come to a time of
suffering again, so must we be careful that not the smallest
grain of wheat be wasted.</p>

<h2>A DEFENSE FOR THE TOWN</h2>

<p>When the spring had come, and before it was time
to put seed into the ground, our fathers set about building
a defense for
the town.</p>

<p>If you remember,
I have already
set down that this
new village of ours
was on a point,
connected with
the main coast
only by a very narrow strip of land. Now to defend
our town from an attack by enemies, save they should
come by water, it was only necessary the defence be
built on this narrow neck, or strip, and so it was
built.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-078.jpg" width="301" height="194" alt="" />
</div>

<p>From one side to the other, extending even down into
the water, was a palisade, or fence, of heavy logs, in the
middle of which stood a gate to give entrance, and the
law was that it should be shut at sunset, not to be opened
again until day had dawned.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span></p>

<h2>THE PROBLEM OF SERVANTS</h2>

<p>Since coming here we have seen so many Indians as
to become acquainted with them, which is to say, that
we no longer look upon them as savages, and have no
fear to stand in the road when they pass. But those
whom Susan and I had seen, up to the day when
Chickatabut, the chief man of the Massachusetts tribe,
came, were only common
people, and such
servants as are employed
here in the
town, for you must
know that more than
one family has a Narragansett
Indian, or,
mayhap, a Nipmuck,
to work in the house.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-079.jpg" width="258" height="322" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Mother says that she
would rather do all the
work of the house
alone, than have one of the brown women to help
her, for they are not cleanly to look upon, but as for
myself, I think I could stand the sight of one of them,
especially when it comes to soap making, of which I
will tell you later.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span></p>

<p>Of course there are times when housewives must
have some one to aid them, and those girls or women
among us who would go out to work in the house are not
many in numbers, therefore one must put up with the
Indians, which is unpleasant, or take those who are
known as indentured servants, meaning the people
who have agreed with the Massachusetts Bay Company
to work for so many years, in order to pay for their
passage over from England.</p>

<p>As for these last people, mother will not have them in
the house, because of being afraid that we may not get
one of good morals. Therefore in our home mother
and I do all that is needed, rather than have around us
people of whom we know nothing.</p>

<h2>CHICKATABUT</h2>

<p>It was not regarding the Indians, or free willers, as
indentured servants are called, that I intended to write
when I began. That which I counted to say was, that
when the spring had come, after the arrival of the <i>Lyon</i>,
and we were free for the time being from fears of a
famine, the Indian by the name of Chickatabut came
to see Governor Winthrop, having been invited to the
end that he might sell us, who are here in Boston, this
piece of land on which we are building our town.</p>

<p>You must know that he is quite the most important
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
savage roundabout here, and father believes, as does
Governor Winthrop, that if he sells us the land, it will
be a lawful bargain, because of his standing, as I
have said, at the head of all these brown people nearabout.</p>

<p>Now it so chanced that he was the first savage of note
I had seen, and really he was something grand to look
upon. He had feathers on his head, like unto a crown,
and from this drooped a long trail of feathers reaching
to the ground, while his leggings and doublet of tanned
deer skin were covered
with beads,
worked in fanciful
patterns, together
with the claws of
beasts. His arrows
were carried across
his back, in a covering
embroidered
with the quills of the
porcupine painted in
various colors, and
he held his bow in
his hand.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-081.jpg" width="286" height="364" alt="" />
</div>

<p>I cannot set down
as I would, exactly how he was dressed, because, having
come upon him suddenly while on my way to Susan's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
house, of being startled by so much of adornment that
I was like to have run away.</p>

<p>He came, as I have said, to visit Governor Winthrop,
and father declares that he sat at the table as a white
man would have done, save that instead of using the
knife and spoon, he took up food with his fingers.
Mother thinks that the Governor must have been relieved
indeed when his guest departed, for no one insists
so strictly upon proper table manners as does
Master Winthrop.</p>

<p>It must have been that Chickatabut was pleased
with his visit, for two or three days after having gone
back to his people, he sent the Governor as much Indian
corn as would fill a hogshead, and, in return for the
gift, Master Winthrop presented him with a suit of
clothing made in English fashion by a tailor.</p>

<p>Father says that now indeed do we own all the land
this side of the neck, for Master Blackstone, who had
a farm here, as I have already said, sold it to our people
before we moved over from Charlestown, and now with
Chickatabut's selling of the same, there should be no
question as to who has a lawful claim upon it.</p>

<h2>BUILDING A SHIP</h2>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-083.jpg" width="290" height="379" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Although, in my own mind, there was never any doubt
but that the land was rightfully ours without consulting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
a savage about it, yet I believe, from all I heard
said, that our people felt better in mind after this
Indian chief had
agreed to our staying
here, for it
seemed as if he
had no sooner
made the bargain
than work was
pushed forward
more as it would
have been done in
England.</p>

<p>As for instance,
Governor Winthrop
began building
a vessel, and
now, if you please, we are to have a ship of our own,
made in Boston, launched in Boston, and to sail from
Boston.</p>

<p>When she is finished, and has sailed to Southampton
or Liverpool, the people there must begin to believe
that we of the Massachusetts Bay Colony are getting
well on in the world if we can own fleets, for in case one
vessel can be built, there is no reason why we should not
have many, while there is so much of lumber everywhere
around.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span></p>

<h2>HOUSEHOLD CONVENIENCES</h2>

<p>Do you know what a betty-lamp is? We have two
in our house, which were brought over by Captain
Pierce of the <i>Lyon</i>, as a gift to my mother.</p>

<p>You, who have more or less trouble with your rush
lights, cannot fancy how luxurious it is to have one of
these betty-lamps, which costs in care no more than is
required to fill them with grease or oil.</p>

<p>Fearing lest you may not know what these lamps are,
which Susan's mother says should be called brown-bettys,
I will do my best to set down here such a description
as shall bring them before you.</p>

<p>The two which we have are made of brass; but
Captain Pierce says they are also to be found of pewter
or of iron.</p>

<p>These are round, and very much the same shape
as half an apple, save that they have a nose an inch or
two long, which sticks out from one side. The body
of the bowl is filled with tallow or grease, and
the wick, or a piece of twisted cloth, is threaded
into the nose, with one end hanging out to be
lighted.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-084.jpg" width="75" height="194" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Ours hang by chains from the ceiling, and the
light which they give is certainly equal to, if not
stronger than, that of a wax candle; but they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
are not so cleanly, because if the wick be ever so little
too long, the lamps send forth a great smoke.</p>

<p>Father says he has seen a ph&oelig;be-lamp, which is
much like our betty-lamps, save that it has a small cup
underneath the nose to catch the dripping grease, and
that I think would be a great improvement, if indeed it
is possible to improve upon so useful an article of household
furniture as this.</p>

<p>Speaking of our betty-lamps reminds me that Susan's
mother had sent over to her in the <i>Lyon</i>, a set of cob
irons, which are something after the fashion of andirons,
or fire-dogs, save that
they are also intended
to hold the spit and the
dripping pan. She had
also a pair of "creepers,"
which are small
andirons, and
which she sometimes
used with
the cob irons.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-085.jpg" width="321" height="252" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The andirons which we brought from England are
much too fine to be used in this fireplace, which is filled
with pothooks, trammels, hakes, and other cooking
utensils.</p>

<p>They were a wedding present to my mother, and are
in what we call "sets of three," meaning that on each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
side of the fireplace are three andirons; one to hold the
heavy logs that are at the bottom of the fire; another
raised still higher to bear the weight of the smaller
sticks, and a third for much the same purpose as the
second; or, perhaps, to make up more of an ornament,
for they are of iron and brass, and are exceeding
beautiful to look upon.</p>

<p>I have used the words trammels and hakes, but it is
possible that you may not know their meaning, and so
I will add by way of explanation that though they are
both hooks upon which we may hang pots and kettles,
the trammel is so constructed that it may be lengthened
or shortened, being made of two parts.</p>

<h2>HOW THE WORK IS DIVIDED</h2>

<p>There is no good reason why I should make any
attempt at setting down here all that was done by our
people in the way of planting, in order that we might
have such a harvest in the fall as would put far from
us the fear of another famine.</p>

<p>It should be easy for you to fancy how we are employed
here in this new town. Some of the men are
working at the palisade, or barricade on the Neck;
others are in the field planting and hoeing, while yet
another company is in the shipyard on the Mystic
River.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<p>Ten or twelve of the people are constantly fishing, or
hunting, to add to the food supply, while those servingmen
or laborers who are not skilled at other work are
cutting trees into fuel,
and otherwise clearing
the land that it may be
tilled another year.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-087.jpg" width="251" height="378" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The women and children
are no less busy,
and it is easy for you to
guess what their duties
are. These log houses,
while not requiring as
much care as if they
were mansions, need
very much in the way of
woman's work.</p>

<p>Lest the shiftless ones,
who have no pride in the
appearance of the town, or are too lazy to do other than
what may be absolutely necessary, should allow the dirt to
gather round about the outside of the houses, a law has
been made obliging each person to keep free from dirt or
filth of any kind, all the land surrounding his dwelling
for a distance of fifty paces, whether in the street or
garden, and it is upon us children that this last work
falls.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span></p>

<p>Save for the babies, and those who are abed with
sickness, there are no idle ones in Boston, and well indeed
it should be so, for it surely is true that "Satan
finds some mischief still for idle hands to do." If we
were not busily engaged during all the waking hours,
then would we have opportunity to grow homesick, for
much as we are growing to like this New World, there
will come now and then thoughts of the homes we left
in England, and one's heart falls sad at realizing that,
perhaps, never again will we see those whom we left
behind when the <i>Arabella</i> sailed out of Southampton.</p>

<h2>LAUNCHING THE SHIP</h2>

<p>It is not well that I let my mind go back into the past.
I should think only of the future, and of what we are
doing here in Boston, the most important of which just
now is the launching of our ship.</p>

<p>She is what sailors call "bark rigged," which is the
same as saying that she has three masts; but yet not as
much of rigging as a ship.</p>

<p>Her name, painted on the stern, is <i>Blessing of the Bay</i>,
and there is hardly any need for me to say that every
man, woman, and child in the town stood near at hand
to see her as she slipped down the well greased ways
into the river, where she rode as gracefully as a swan.</p>

<p>I have already said that when the <i>Lyon</i> came in, at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
the time of the famine, she appeared the most beautiful
vessel I had ever seen, and next to her comes the <i>Blessing
of the Bay</i>. As Governor Winthrop said in the
short lecture he gave us before launching, she was
Boston made, of Boston timber, and would be sailed
by Boston sailors, so that when she goes out across the
ocean, people shall know that there are Englishmen
far overseas who are striving, with God's help, to make
a country which shall one day stand equal with the
England we have left forever.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-089.jpg" width="458" height="328" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It is while speaking of the launching that I am reminded
of a very comical mishap to Master Winthrop,
and I may set it down without disrespect to him, for he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
is pleased to join in the mirth whenever it is spoken of
as something to cause laughter.</p>

<h2>MASTER WINTHROP'S MISHAP</h2>

<p>It seems that the wolves had been worrying some of
the goats that Master Winthrop brought over to this
country with him, and on a certain day, after supper, he
went out with his gun in the hope of killing a few of the
ravenous beasts.</p>

<p>He had not traveled more than half a mile from home
when night came on, and, turning about to go back, as
was prudent, for it is not safe that one man shall be
alone in the forest after dark, because of the wild animals,
he mistook his path, wandering directly away
from the river, instead of toward it.</p>

<p>I myself have heard him say that he must have walked
a full hour, and was growing exceeding uncomfortable in
mind, when he came to an Indian hut that was built of
branches of trees and of skins, so that it formed a fairly
comfortable dwelling, and was of sufficient strength to resist
the efforts of any one to enter, save through the door.</p>

<p>There was no person inside this hut or wigwam; the
door was unfastened, and the Governor, understanding
that he must have some shelter during the night, else
was he in danger of being devoured by wild beasts,
entered as if it were his own dwelling.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span></p>

<p>With his flint and steel he built a fire, and by its light,
saw, piled up in one corner of the place, mats such as
the savages use to sleep upon. Having taken a mouthful
of snakeweed, which is said to be of great benefit in
quieting one's nerves, and prayed to God for safe keeping
during the night, he lay down.</p>

<p>Before much time had passed, and certainly while his
eyes were yet wide open, it began to rain, and some of
the water finding its way through the carelessly thatched
roof, disturbed his rest, so that it was impossible to sleep.</p>

<p>He spent the night singing psalms, gathering such
wood as he could handily come at from the outside,
to keep the fire going,
and pacing to and fro
in the narrow space,
until near to daylight,
when an Indian squaw
came that way.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-091.jpg" width="258" height="377" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The Governor, hearing
her voice as she
cried out to whosoever
owned the hut and was
evidently a friend of
hers, barred the door
as best he might, while
she stood on the outside
beating it with her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
hands, and calling aloud in the Indian language, first
in friendly terms, and then angrily; but yet he made
no reply.</p>

<p>The door held firm against her efforts until day came,
when the Governor walked out of the hut, not dreaming
the woman would make an attack upon him, but straightway
he was forced to take to his heels, or, as he laughingly
declared, she would have clawed out his eyes.</p>

<p>Although we children knew nothing whatsoever concerning
it, the chief men of the town had been greatly
alarmed because of the Governor's disappearance, and
during the whole of the night no less than twenty had
walked to and fro in the forest hunting for him; but by
an unkind chance never going in the direction of this
hut. When Master Winthrop made his appearance,
it had just been decided that a hue and cry should be
raised, and all the men in Boston be called to aid in the
search.</p>

<h2>NEW ARRIVALS</h2>

<p>It was during this summer, when Captain Pierce
brought the <i>Lyon</i> to us for the third time, that Mistress
Winthrop, the Governor's wife came over.</p>

<p>John Eliot, the preacher, was also one of the passengers,
and they had even a longer voyage than had
we in the <i>Arabella</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Lyon</i> left Southampton about the middle of
August, and did not arrive here until the fourth of
November, when she came to anchor off Nantasket.</p>

<p>Then indeed did we have a week of rejoicing, sharing
in the Governor's gladness that his family was with him
once more. All those who could get boats to convey
them, went down off Nantasket, and when Mistress
Winthrop stepped ashore at the foot of our cove, she
was honored by volleys from all the firearms in the
town.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-093.jpg" width="457" height="314" alt="" />
</div>

<p>During three days that followed, it was as if the
people believed Master Winthrop and his loved ones
were in danger of starvation, for, from the highest to
the lowest in the town, each brought some gift of food,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
such as fat hogs, goats, deer meat, geese, partridges,&mdash;in
fact, anything that could be eaten, save clams, fish,
and lobsters, of which we had already more than plenty
enough to dull one's appetite for such eating.</p>

<p>Those who read what I have here set down, may
charge me with speaking overly much concerning what
we had to eat, and yet I question whether any of our
company who passed through the famine of the year
of 1630, and the pinching times of 1631 and 1632,
could do otherwise than dwell upon our store of food.</p>

<h2>ANOTHER FAMINE</h2>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-094.jpg" width="291" height="276" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Now, if you please, I will set down at once that which
is in my mind concerning it, so that I need not weary
you by repeating. This first year of harvest was a
fairly plentiful one,
and would have
sufficed for all our
wants during the
coming winter, had
it not been that
other people were
joining us by every
ship, nearly all of
whom were poorly
provided for, having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
left England in the belief that we were dwelling
amid plenty.</p>

<p>Therefore it was, that to feed these new comers as
well as ourselves, we were frequently hard pressed for
what was actually needed to save ourselves the pangs
of hunger.</p>

<p>It is true that during this summer of 1631 many
cattle were sent from England; but so many died
during the voyage, that those which lived seemed extremely
precious, because from them were we counting
on our future herds. People who had spent their
money in England buying twenty cows, but succeeded
in bringing to Boston only four, could not afford to
kill them for the sake of meat, more especially since the
very life of our colony depended upon their increase.</p>

<p>We had famine in the first year; we were cramped for
food during the second year, yet consoled ourselves
with the thought that when another season had come,
there would be so much seed put into the ground that
there could be no question of lack of whatever might
be needed.</p>

<p>But the summer of our third year in Boston was cold
and wet; the crop of corn failed almost entirely, and
again were we forced to seek our food from the sea, or
to dig for clams; but even this last was extremely difficult,
owing to the exceedingly cold winter of that season.</p>

<p>The Charles river was frozen from shore to shore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
and it was as if the snow fell almost every day, until the
drifts were piled so high roundabout our town that,
save in the very center of the village, we could not
move about.</p>

<p>Another famine was staring us in the face when the
winter came to an end, and we knew that unless help
should reach us from the outside, we could not add to
our stores until another harvest time.</p>

<p>Then it was that we realized the value of having
neighbors, and truly these were neighbors indeed, who,
at Jamestown in the New World, had such store of food,
as would allow them to lade a ship wholly with corn,
sending her, through God's direction, to that port where
the supply was most needed.</p>

<p>Lest I weary you with too many words regarding our
hunger, I will set it down thus briefly, that, except at
rare intervals, we were pinched for food during the first
five years we lived in Boston, and not until that time
had passed were we free from further fear of famine.</p>

<h2>FINE CLOTHING FORBIDDEN</h2>

<p>And yet we did not spend all our time complaining
one to another lest on the morrow we should be hungry,
and in proof of this I am minded to set down here that
which I have copied from the law made in our town
four years after we came across from Charlestown:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
"That no person, either man or woman, shall hereafter
make or buy any apparel, either woolen, or silk, or linen
with any lace on it, silver, gold, or thread, under the penalty
of forfeiture of said cloths. Also that no person, either man
or woman, shall make or buy any slashed cloths, other than
one slash in each sleeve, and another in the back; also all
cut-works, embroideries, or needle-work, capbands, and rails
are forbidden hereafter to be made and worn under the
aforesaid penalty; also all gold and silver girdles, hatbands,
belts, ruffs, beaver hats are prohibited to be bought and worn
hereafter."
</p></div>

<p>Mother says it is because of our people having given
themselves up to vanity that the Lord laid His hand
heavily upon us by cutting off the harvest, and yet it
seems to me, although I question not that which she
has said, that the good God would never punish all
our people for the sin which a few committed.</p>

<p>Yet, perhaps, there were more than a few who committed
the sin, else why should it have been that our
wise men felt it necessary to forbid fanciful dress, as
they did in this law which I have set down?</p>

<h2>OUR FIRST CHURCH</h2>

<p>Not until the second year after Boston was settled,
did we have a building devoted entirely to the worship
of God. Then was built of logs, neatly hewn and
set together with much care, so that both the outside
and the inside were smooth and fair to look upon, that
which we called our church.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span></p>

<p>The sides did
not stand as tall as
some of our dwellings;
but the roof
was much higher
and sharper, so
that inside it looked
to be very large.
There were four
windows in each
side, and all of them contained glass, if you please.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-098.jpg" width="293" height="257" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The pulpit, with a well fashioned sounding-board
of odorous cedar above it, stood at the end of the building
farthest from the door, and there were near about it
eight pews made much after the same shape as those in
the church at home. In these sit the magistrates, the
elders and the deacons, with the men on one side, the
women and girls on the other, and the boys in one corner,
where the tithing-men may keep them in order.</p>

<p>Back of these pews were benches sufficient in number
to give seats to all our people, and if it could have
been that Master Winthrop and those in authority
believed we might worship God quite as well while
comfortable in body, so that we had a fireplace, it
would have delighted me much.</p>

<p>It seems almost a sin to complain because of being
cold while one is praising God, and yet during this long,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
dreary winter when the earth was piled high with
snow, and the river imprisoned in ice, it was well nigh
impossible, after having remained in the same position
two or three hours, to prevent one's teeth from chattering
so sharply that the noise might disturb others.</p>

<p>It seems to me that one could enjoy a sermon much
better if one were not wishing for the warmth of the
fireplace at home.</p>

<p>Many of our people have what is called a foot-stove
to take with them to meeting, and it seems to me a
most comfortable arrangement;
but mother says that if our
love of God be not strong
enough to prevent discomfort
simply because of the frost,
when such a man as Master
Wilson, or either of the preachers, or Governor Winthrop,
is pleased to deliver a sermon, then are we
utterly lost.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-099.jpg" width="189" height="134" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Susan declares that she <i>was</i> lost the first winter we
came here, when her cheeks were frost-bitten during
one of Master Winthrop's lectures, which took no more
than two hours in the speaking.</p>

<p>These foot-stoves, which I wish most fervently my
father would believe we might be permitted to use, are
square boxes made of iron, pierced with many tiny
holes, and having a handle by which they can be carried.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
One of these, filled with live coals, will keep
warm a very long time, especially if it be covered with
skins, and I envy Mistress Winthrop and her daughter,
even while knowing how great is the sin, when they sit
in the Governor's pew so comfortably warm that there
is no fear their teeth will, by chattering, cause unseemly
disturbance.</p>

<h2>A TROUBLESOME PERSON</h2>

<p>There are certain matters concerning which I was
minded not to speak, because of their causing both
Susan and me very much of sadness at the time, and it
has seemed as if I had set down little else except trouble
and suffering, whereas there was very much of the time
when we of Boston enjoyed our life in the New World.</p>

<p>That some will not live as God would have them,
we know only too well, and we found one such among
us during the second year after our village was built.
Thomas Morton was the person who gave the officers
of Boston no little trouble, and in order to tell understandingly
the story of what he did, I must go back to
that time, two years before we landed here, when the
people of Plymouth had cause to complain against this
same man.</p>

<p>From what I have heard father say, he had been a
lawyer in the city of London, and came over to Plymouth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
hoping to better his fortunes; but because of not being a
God-fearing man, the religious spirit of the colonies
was little to his liking.</p>

<h2>THE VILLAGE OF MERRY MOUNT</h2>

<p>Within five or six miles of where stands our village,
had been, a few years before, a settlement which one
Captain Wollaston began, and, tiring of the enterprise,
went back to England, leaving there some few of his
followers, who were ungodly people.</p>

<p>This Thomas Morton, believing himself held in too
close restraint at Plymouth, sought out these people at
Wollaston, and became one of them, to the shame and
reproach of all godly-minded people in this New World.
He changed the name of the village to Merry Mount;
was chosen leader of the company there, and made of
the place a perfect Sodom.</p>

<p>It is said, so I have heard my father say, that they
had no religious services, save now and then, when in a
spirit of wickedness this Thomas Morton read from
the prayer book. He increased the number of his
following by enticing the servants away from the good
folks of Plymouth.</p>

<p>It gave much offence to them that such a village
should be in the land where they had come to set
up the true worship of God, therefore Captain Miles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
Standish, a soldier of Plymouth, went with a force of
men to Merry Mount, seized this Thomas Morton, and
sent him to England that he might answer for his
crimes to the London Company.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-102.jpg" width="461" height="408" alt="" />
</div>

<h2>PUNISHING THOMAS MORTON</h2>

<p>What happened there my father does not know; but
certain it is that when the <i>Lyon</i> came on her second
voyage, she brought among her passengers this same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
Thomas Morton, and from the moment he arrived
our people had trouble with him.</p>

<p>He brought considerable property in the way of
firearms, powder and shot, and, without asking permission
from the chief men of our town, set about
trading these goods with the Indians for furs, as he
had done at Merry Mount, which was not only a
menace to all the white people in this new country,
because of furnishing the savages with arms that might
be used to kill us, but directly against the law which
forbade trafficking with the Indians.</p>

<p>He must have been a wicked man indeed, for, not
content with doing that which our people had forbidden,
he cheated the savages by selling them black
sand for powder, and demanding more of furs than
was fair and just for such goods as he gave them.</p>

<p>Of course one may think that his crime against us
was lessened when he weighed out worthless sand,
instead of powder that might be used to our harm;
but the chief men of Boston claimed that the savages
must be dealt with fairly, otherwise would they look
upon us, who were willing to trade honestly, as rogues
and thieves.</p>

<p>Therefore it was that our people seized this Thomas
Morton, gave him fair trial before the court, and sentenced
him to four and twenty hours in the bilboes, after
which he was again to be sent as prisoner to England.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-104.jpg" width="258" height="241" alt="" />
</div>
<p>It may be that some do not know what bilboes are,
and I can explain because of having seen them while
they were on Thomas Morton.</p>

<p>A bilboe is a long bar of iron, on which are two
heavy clamps, in shape not unlike bracelets which
ladies of quality wear upon their arms, fastened by a
ring to the bar in such manner that they may slide back
and forth. These
clamps, or clasps, are
placed upon the prisoner's
ankles, and pushed
apart until his legs are
stretched wide. His
hands are tied behind
his back, and he is
forced to sit upon the
ground, unable to give
relief to his aching limbs, because of the bar's being
too weighty for him to move it.</p>

<p>All of Thomas Morton's goods were seized to pay the
charges of the trial, and also to make good to the Indians
what they had lost through his knavishness. The
house which he had built, and it was a fair one made
of heavy logs, was burned in the presence of the prisoner
and the court, as a sign that we of Boston would
not countenance dishonest tricks, even when they were
played upon the savages.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<h2>PHILIP RATCLIFF'S CRIME</h2>

<p>The punishment of Thomas Morton saddened Susan
and myself sorely; but not so much as when one Philip
Ratcliff was punished.</p>

<p>He was such a wicked man that he went around the
town saying he believed the devil was at the head of
our church, and in every way casting reproach upon
religion, despite the fact of his having been warned
again and again that unless he put a bridle to his tongue,
punishment would speedily follow.</p>

<p>He did not give heed to the warning, however, and
after a time, which was during the third summer of
our being in this land, he was brought before the court
as one who had cast reproach upon God. For this he
was sentenced to be whipped, to have his ears cut off,
to be fined forty shillings, and afterward to be banished
to England.</p>

<p>Because of this man's being so very, very wicked,
Susan and I believed we should go to see him whipped,
and gathered with the people at the pillory, where he
stood with his neck and arms clutched by the heavy
bars of wood; but when Samuel Morgan made ready
the heavy whip, just as the man's back was bared to
receive the lashes, we turned away in horror, not daring
to look.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span></p>

<p>Father said, when he came home in the evening, that
Ratcliff bore the whipping and the ear-cutting without
a cry; but when it was over, he threatened vengeance
against us, after he should be set free in England, and
later we came to know what he meant by such threats.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-106.jpg" width="462" height="376" alt="" />
</div>

<p>He went everywhere about in the old country, telling
that the New World was a hideous wilderness in which
roamed the wildest savages thirsting for the blood of
white people; that the land was rocky and barren, and
not fit for farms, for no crops could be raised upon it;
that the weather was cold, and that the climate caused
deathly sickness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span></p>

<p>All this, father said, worked to our harm among
those godly people who were inclined to join us, for
they feared to come into such a place, not understanding
that these things were lies which had been told out of a
spirit of revenge.</p>

<h2>IN THE PILLORY</h2>

<p>Another wicked person who had come to Boston was
Henry Linn, who was no sooner living among us than
he wrote letters to England by every vessel, full of
slander against the churches, and of those who took
part in the government.</p>

<p>He was forced to stand in the pillory from sunrise to
sunset, and was then sent back to England with the
warning that if he ever returned, worse punishment
would follow.</p>

<p>It has come to my mind that possibly some who read
these words may not have seen a pillory, for I am told
that there are places in this world where the people so
fear God and love their neighbors that there is no need
they be punished, therefore will I set down as best I may,
a description of that instrument of shame that stands
near to where lives Master Wilson.</p>

<p>First a platform of logs is made of such height that
he who stands upon it can be seen of all the people,
and from the center of this rises a stout log to the height
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
of four feet or more. On the top of the upright timber,
and fastened immovable, is a puncheon plank
on the upper edge of which are cut three grooves, the
middle one large enough to contain a man's neck and
the other two his wrists. Now a second plank is
fashioned to fit down over the first one, with other
grooves in it to match.</p>

<p>Whosoever must be punished is forced to stand upon
this platform with his head and arms fastened securely
in the holes of the planks, exposed to the view of all
the people during so long a time as the sentence demands.</p>

<p>In addition to being a most shameful punishment, it
must be exceeding painful, for one may not stand
very long in the same position without becoming
cramped, and he who is in the pillory cannot move
hands or head.</p>

<h2>STEALING FROM THE INDIANS</h2>

<p>I grieve to say that there were some among our people
who seemed to believe there was nothing of crime that
could be committed against a savage, and Master
Josias Plastow, whom we had ever looked upon as a
godly man, showed himself to be knavish where the
brown people were concerned.</p>

<p>Chickatabut, the chief of the Massachusetts Indians,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
of whom I have already spoken, brought proof to Boston
that Master Plastow had stolen three half-bushels of
corn from some of his people, living near Neponset,
and on being charged with the offence by Governor
Winthrop, Master Plastow confessed that he had done
so, claiming that it was not stealing to take from the
savages.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-109.jpg" width="454" height="360" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The Governor and his assistants thought differently,
though, for Master Plastow was fined five pounds in
money, and ordered to send six half-bushels of corn
to the Indians from whom he had stolen, after which
all people were forbidden to call him Master any more,
but must give him only the name of Josias.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Stone believed this sentence to be wrong,
and openly called the justice unseemly names. He
was straightway summoned before the court, and fined
one hundred pounds in money for speaking disrespectfully
of one in authority.</p>

<p>Nor was this the only case where fault was found
with the punishment inflicted upon Josias. Henry
Lyon wrote a letter to a cousin of his in Plymouth,
another to a friend in Salem, and sent four to London,
all of which were filled with harsh words against the
Governor of Boston, and the manner in which justice
was dealt out. He was given twelve lashes on the bare
back, and banished to England.</p>

<h2>THE PASSING OF NEW LAWS</h2>

<p>When we had been in this village two years, there was
much vexation because of the greater portion of the gold
and silver money, which our people had brought with
them, having been sent back to England in order to purchase
goods there, and the result was that even those
who were well off in the things of this world, found
themselves unable to pay their debts.</p>

<p>Therefore it was that the court ordered corn to be
taken in the stead of gold and silver, unless money,
or beaver skins, were set down in the writing as the
method of payment agreed upon.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span></p>

<p>At the same time another law was passed, part of which
seemed to bear heavily upon those who were homesick
to the point of going back to England, and yet may
have offended the officers of the law in some way.
It was declared that no person should be allowed to
depart out of the town of Boston, either by sea or by
land, or to buy goods out of any vessel or of the Indians,
without permission from the magistrates.</p>

<p>I know it is not seemly for a girl to question that
which her elders have done, and yet there were many
times when it seemed to me as if such a law worked
injury to us of Boston.</p>

<p>I might not have given so much heed to matters which
do not concern girls, but for the fact that Susan's father
had crossed the Neck on his way in search of wild animals,
and having come some four miles into the forest,
he met an Indian who had on his back a half-bushel
of corn in a basket.</p>

<p>The savage took
a fancy to the girdle
he wore, offered
to give him the
corn, and bring as
much more on the
following day, if
the belt were given
to him then.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-111.jpg" width="287" height="286" alt="" />
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span></p>

<p>Susan's father, believing that the law against buying
provisions of an Indian would not be carried so far
as to prevent a bargain like the one which the savage
had offered, stripped off his belt and took the corn.</p>

<p>On coming back to the town, Samuel Goodlove, one
of the tithing-men, met him, and asked how it chanced
he had set forth in search of wild fowl and brought
back corn.</p>

<p>Thinking no harm, Susan's father told all that
had been done in the forest, and straightway he was
brought before Governor Winthrop, who fined him ten
shillings and the corn he had brought on his back four
miles, for having offended the law. In addition, he
was sentenced to give back to the Indian as much corn
as he had taken, but without demanding from him
the girdle that had been given over.</p>

<h2>MASTER PORMONT'S SCHOOL</h2>

<p>Five years after we were settled in this town of Boston,
a school was set up for young people, and such
children of the Indians as wished to attend were allowed
to do so freely without payment, although every white
man was forced to pay each year a certain amount,
either in money or in goods, for the hire of the teacher,
who was Master Philemon Pormont.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that we children knew nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
whatsoever of reading, writing, or of doing small
sums in arithmetic, up to this time. A certain portion
of each day did my mother or father teach me my lessons,
and when Master Pormont opened his school, I
could write as fair a hand as I do now, which seems
fortunate, for he was not skilful in teaching the art of
writing.</p>

<p>As for myself, I truly believe that had my first lessons
in the use of a quill come from him, I had never
known how to form a letter, because of his being exceeding
harsh in his ways.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-113.jpg" width="459" height="296" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A child who failed in doing at the first attempt exactly
as Master Pormont thought fit, was given a sharp
blow over the knuckles of the hand which held the quill,
and Ezra Whitman was punished in this manner so
severely on a certain day, that it was nearly a week
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
before he was able to use his fingers. Even then the
teacher declared that if the blow had been sharper, the
boy would, before the pain had ceased, have known more
about that which he was endeavoring to show him.</p>

<p>The school was first set up in the house that had been
built by Josias Plastow. If you remember, he was one
who had been under the discipline of the court, and it
was forbidden any should call him save by the name of
Josias.</p>

<p>Feeling that he had been harshly dealt with, Josias
left Boston, and went into Plymouth to live, therefore
did his dwelling belong to the town, according to the
law. It was made into a schoolroom by having benches
set up around the four sides, in such fashion that the
scholars faced a ledge of puncheon planks, which was
built against the walls to be used when we needed a desk
on which to write, or to work out sums in arithmetic.</p>

<p>Master Pormont sat upon a platform in the center of
the room, where he could keep us children well in view,
and woe betide the one who neglected his task, for
punishment was certain to follow.</p>

<h2>SCHOOL DISCIPLINE</h2>

<p>There were times when it seemed to me as if Master
Pormont had eyes in the back of his head, for once
when I ventured to ask Susan Freeman for the loan of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
her quill, while he was looking in the opposite direction,
I was speedily called to an account for misbehavior.
Then it was he handed me a knife he carried in his
pocket, and further command was not needed.</p>

<p>I knew full well that I must go outside and cut a
stout switch for use upon my own body, and if peradventure
I had been
so foolish as to
bring back a small
one, the first would
have been used to
switch me with until
it was broken,
after which it was
my duty to go for
another of more
weight.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-115.jpg" width="290" height="328" alt="" />
</div>

<p>My hands
smarted a full hour
after the punishment had been dealt out, and there were
such swellings upon them when I got home that mother
tied both up in linen after besmearing them plentifully
with ointment.</p>

<p>It was not always that Master Pormont used a switch
upon a child who had been foolish enough to speak
with his neighbor, for he had what were called whispering-sticks,
which were most disagreeable to wear, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
caused a great deal of pain, so Susan said; but as for
myself, I was never forced to bear such punishment.</p>

<p>These whispering-sticks were stout bits of wood from
the oak tree, which could not readily be broken by
the teeth, and were put into a child's mouth as you
thrust a bit into the mouth of a horse, after which the
two ends were bound securely back of the neck. Thus
the unfortunate one's jaws were stretched wide open,
oftentimes for a full hour.</p>

<h2>OTHER TOOLS OF TORTURE</h2>

<p>It seemed to me then, and does even now, that Master
Pormont spent more time devising means of punishment
than in teaching us our lessons, for he had as
many torture tools of various kinds as would have
served to make a heavy load for either of us children.</p>

<p>That which the lads most feared was the flapper, and
truly it was well contrived to cause pain. It was a piece
of stout deer hide, or thick leather, four or five inches
wide, and twice as long, with a hole in the center about
as large as the end of my thumb. One end of this was
tied to a stout handle, and, when applying it, Master
Pormont forced the child who had disobeyed the rules
of school, to lie over one of the benches in such a
manner that he could come at the lad's bare skin. When
the flapper was laid on vigorously, at each blow the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
flesh would puff up through this hole in the center of
the leather, in a way most painful to behold.</p>

<p>There is little need for me to say that Master Pormont
had a number of dunce's caps made of bark from
the birch tree, on which were painted different inscriptions
to suit the offence, such as "Stupid Boy,"
for one who could not readily answer the questions he
asked concerning the day's lessons; "A Silly Dunce,"
to fit one who was slow in learning; "A Wicked Liar,"
for some lad who had not told the truth.</p>

<p>In fact, I cannot set down all the names which
Master Pormont had written on these dunce's caps,
and there was hardly an hour during the day when at
least one of them was
not in use.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-117.jpg" width="261" height="363" alt="" />
</div>

<p>That contrivance
which he had for children
who would not
sit quietly on their
benches, was, seemingly,
the most innocent,
and yet, as I
know to my sorrow,
caused a vast amount
of pain. It was a small
square of puncheon
plank with a single
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
stick in the center as a leg, and on this the culprit was
forced to sit, balancing himself or herself as best might
be by the feet, without being allowed to touch the
hands to anything.</p>

<p>As I thus set down the poor description it seems a
harmless thing, and a punishment too mild to meet a
grave offence, but yet if you were to try to balance
yourself on this unipod, as Master Pormont called it,
for the space of an hour, every joint in your body would
cry aloud with pain.</p>

<p>As for myself, I know that more than once I would
rather have fallen headlong from this unipod, than
have endured the torture a single moment, even had I
not known that more severe punishment would follow
such a disregard of the rules of school.</p>

<h2>DIFFICULT LESSONS</h2>

<p>The first lesson which Master Pormont gave to those
of us children who could read and write fairly well, was
from the Latin grammar, and he required that we have
at our tongue's end within the first day, the different
forms of no less than six verbs; and this regardless of
the fact that we had never so much as put our eyes to
the language before!</p>

<p>Do not let it be understood that I am in any way
complaining of whatsoever Master Pormont did, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
although I could not understand the reason for many
of the lessons at that time, there can be no question but
that so wise a man as he knew what was best suited
for us children.</p>

<p>But surely, to Susan and me, who knew no more of
arithmetic than was to be found in the multiplying,
dividing, and adding of small sums, it was most grievous
work to stumble over such terms as "fret," "tare," and
"net," when we had no idea of their meaning.</p>

<p>Nor would Master Pormont give us such information,
claiming that we should seek it from our parents, or
from other people in the town, to the end that if it
was gained by much labor we would the longer remember
it.</p>

<h2>OTHER SCHOOLS</h2>

<p>To me it was a great relief when dame schools were
established, and by this term I mean schools that were
taught by women.</p>

<p>Some of our more tender-hearted people believed
Master Pormont's methods were too harsh for the
younger children; therefore, after he had kept school
one year, Mistress Sowerby, who was the widow of
Master Sowerby who had been assistant in the church
at Yarmouth, in England, was hired at the wage of six
pounds a year to teach the girls and the smaller boys.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span></p>

<p>She did not appear to think it necessary that young
ladies should know so very much concerning Latin
grammar, or arithmetic; but rather spent her time
showing us how to spin tow strings, or to knit hose or
stockings.</p>

<p>Because of the school's having been set up in her
own home, we could learn how to cook, and to weave,
and to knit, not only for our
own use, but to sell, and any
kind of knitting work done
well was in great demand.
When I could do herringbone,
or fox-and-geese patterns,
working them, moreover,
into mittens or stockings, I felt
exceeding proud.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-120.jpg" width="196" height="338" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Indeed, we had among us
one girl who knit into a single
pair of mittens, the alphabet
and a verse of poetry in four
lines.</p>

<p>Mistress Sowerby was most careful in teaching us
the use of the quill, for she claimed that the young
girl or young woman, who could make easy, flowing
letters, need not consider herself ignorant, even though
she failed in arithmetic, or was unable to spell correctly
the words she set down.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span></p>

<p>It seemed to Susan and me as if the people of Boston
were taking great pride in the teaching of their children,
when we learned that four hundred pounds had been
set aside from the money of the town with which to set
up a college, near those plantations which we had come
to call the New Town.</p>

<p>We girls were more than disappointed, however,
when told that only lads would be allowed to enter
this college, and then not until having gained a certain
amount of knowledge elsewhere; but yet it was a matter
in which we could take pride, that there should be
such a school formed when only six years had passed
since we began to build the town of Boston.</p>

<h2>RAISING FLAX</h2>

<p>It would be strange indeed if I failed to set down
anything concerning the flax which we spin, because
save for it we would have had nothing of linen except
what could be brought from England. There is no
question but that every one who reads this will know
exactly how flax is raised and spun into cloth; but yet
I am minded to explain, because we girls of Boston
have more to do with raising flax than with any other
crop.</p>

<p>It is sown early in the spring, and when the plants
are three or four inches high, we girls are obliged to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
weed them, and in so doing are forced to go barefoot,
because of the stalks being very tender and therefore
easily broken down.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-122.jpg" width="460" height="318" alt="" />
</div>

<p>I do not believe there is a child in town who fails to
go into the flax fields, because of its being such work
as can be done by young people better than by older
ones, who are heavier and more likely to injure the
plants.</p>

<p>I have said that we are obliged to go barefooted;
but where there is a heavy growth of thistles, as is
often the case, we girls wear two or three pairs of
woolen stockings to protect our feet.</p>

<p>If there is any wind, we must perforce work facing
it, so that such of the plants as may by accident have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
been trodden down, may be blown back into place by
the breeze.</p>

<p>Wearying labor it is indeed, this weeding of the flax,
and yet those who come into a new world, as have we,
must not complain at whatsoever is set them to do, for
unless much time is expended, crops cannot be raised,
and we children of Boston need only to be reminded of
the famine, when we are inclined to laziness, in order
to set us in motion.</p>

<p>Of course you know that flax is a pretty plant, with
a sweet, drooping, blue flower, and it ripens about the
first of July, when it is pulled up by the roots and laid
carefully out to dry, much as if one were making hay.
This sort of work is always done by the men and boys,
and during two or three days they are forced to turn the
flax again and again, so that the sun may come upon
every part of it.</p>

<h2>PREPARING FLAX</h2>

<p>I despair of trying to tell any one who has never seen
flax prepared, how much and how many different
kinds of labor are necessary, before it can be woven
into the beautiful linen of which our mothers are so
proud.</p>

<p>First it must be rippled. The ripple comb is made
of stout teeth, either wood or iron, set on a puncheon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
and the stalks of flax are pulled through it to break off
the seeds, which fall into a cloth that has been spread
to catch them, so they may be sown for the next year's
harvest.</p>

<p>Of course this kind of work is always done in the
field, and the stalks are then tied in bundles, which are
called "bates," and stacked up something after the
shape of a tent, being high in the middle and broadened
out at the bottom.</p>

<p>After the flax has been exposed to the weather long
enough to be perfectly dry, then water must be sprinkled
over it to rot the
leaves and such
portions of the
stalks as are not
used.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-124.jpg" width="290" height="396" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Then comes that
part of the work
which only strong
men can perform,
called breaking the
flax, to get from
the center of the
stalks the hard,
wood-like "bun,"
which is of no value.
This is done
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
with a machine made of wood, as if you were to set
three or four broad knives on a bench, at a certain distance
apart, with as many more on a lever to come
from above, fitting closely between the lower blades.
The upper part of the machine is pulled down with
force upon the flax, so that every portion of it is
broken.</p>

<p>After this comes the scutching, or swingling, which
is done by chopping with dull knives on a block of
wood to take out the small pieces of bark which may
still be sticking to the fiber.</p>

<p>Now that which remains is made up into bundles,
and pounded again to clear it yet more thoroughly of
what is of no value, after which it is hackled, and the
fineness of the flax depends upon the number of times
it has been hackled, which means, pulling it through a
quantity of iron teeth driven into a board.</p>

<h2>SPINNING, BLEACHING, AND WEAVING FLAX</h2>

<p>After all this preparation has been done, then comes
the spinning, which is, of course, the work of the women
and girls. I am proud to say I could spin a skein of
thread in one day, before I was thirteen years old, and
you must know that this is no mean work for a girl,
since it is reckoned that the best of spinners can do
no more than two skeins.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<p>Of course the skeins must be bleached, otherwise
the cloth made from them would look as if woven of
tow, and this portion of the work mother is always
very careful to look after herself.</p>

<p>The skeins must stay in warm water for at least
four days, and be wrung out dry every hour or two,
when the water is to be changed. Then they are washed
in a brook or river until there is no longer any dust or
dirt remaining, after which they are bricked, which is
the same as if I had said
bleached, with ashes and
hot water, over and over
again, and afterward
left to remain in clear
water a full week.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-126.jpg" width="251" height="387" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Then comes more
rinsing, beating, washing,
drying, and winding
on bobbins; so that
it may be handy for
the loom.</p>

<p>The chief men in Boston
made a law that
all boys and girls be
taught to spin flax, and a certain sum of money was
set aside to be given those who made the best linen
that had been raised, spun, and woven within the town.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span></p>

<p>I am told that in some of the villages nearabout, the
men who make the laws have ordered that every family
shall spin so many pounds of flax each year, or pay a
very large amount of money as a fine for neglecting
to do so.</p>

<p>It is not needed I should set down how flax is spun,
for there is but one way to spin that I know of, whether
the material be wool, cotton, or flax.</p>

<p>But I would I might be able so to set it down, that
whosoever reads could understand, how my mother wove
this linen thread into cloth; but it would require more
of words than I have patience to write.</p>

<p>If there be any who have the desire to know how
the linen for their tables, or for their clothing, is made,
I would advise that the matter be studied as one would
a lesson in school, for it is most interesting, and father
holds to it that every child should be able to make all
of that which he wears.</p>

<h2>WHAT WE GIRLS DO AT HOME</h2>

<p>In this town of Boston, if we do not know how to
make what is needed, then must we perforce go without,
because one cannot well afford to spend the time,
nor the money, required to send from Boston to London
for whatever may be desired, and wait until it
shall be brought across the sea.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>

<p>I wonder if it would interest any of you to know
what Susan and I are obliged to do in our homes during
each working day of the week?</p>

<p>I can remember a time when we were put to it to
perform certain tasks within six days, and have set
down that which we did.</p>

<p>It was on a Monday that Susan and I hackled fifty
pounds of flax, and tired we were when the day was
come to an end. On Tuesday
we carded tow, and on
Wednesday each spun a
skein of linen thread. On
Thursday we did the same
stint, and on Friday made
brooms of guinney wheat
straw. On Saturday we
spun twine out of the coarser
part of flax, which is called
tow, and of which I will tell
you later.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-128.jpg" width="219" height="311" alt="" />
</div>

<p>All this we did in a single
week, in addition to helping our mothers about the
house, and had no idea that we were working overly
hard.</p>

<p>And now about tow: when flax has been prepared
to that stage where it is to be hackled, the fibers
pulled out by the comb are yet further divided into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
cobweb-like threads, and laid carefully one above the
other as straight as may be. To these a certain yellow
substance sticks, which we call tow, and this can be
spun into coarse stuff for aprons and mats, or into
twine, which, by the way, is not very strong.</p>

<p>It would surprise you, when working flax, to see to
how small a bulk it may be reduced. What seems
like an enormous stack, before being made ready for
spinning, is lessened to such extent that you may
readily take it in both hands, and then comes the next
surprise, when you see how much cloth can be woven
out of so small an amount of threads.</p>

<p>As for myself, I am not any too fond of working
amid the flax, save when it comes to spinning; but such
labor is greatest pleasure as compared with soap-making,
which is to my mind the most disagreeable
and slovenly of all the housewife's duties.</p>

<h2>MAKING SOAP</h2>

<p>It seems strange that some industrious person, who
is not overly fine in feelings or in habits, does not take
it upon himself to make soap for sale. Verily it would
be better that a family like ours buy a quart of soap
whenever it is needed, than for the whole house to be
turned topsy-turvy because of the dirty work.</p>

<p>I wonder if there are in this country any girls so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
fortunate as not to have been obliged to learn how to
make soap? I know of none in Boston, although it
may be possible that in Salem, where are some lately
come over from England, live those who still know the
luxury of hard soap, such as can be bought in London.</p>

<p>For those fortunate ones I will set down how my
mother and I make a barrel of soap, for once we are
forced to get about the task, we contrive to make up
as large a quantity as possible.</p>

<p>First, as you well know, we save all the grease which
cannot be used in cooking, and is not needed for candles,
until we have four and twenty pounds of such
stuff as the fat of meat, scraps of suet, and drippings of
wild turkey or wild geese, which last is not pleasant
to use in food, and not fit for candles.</p>

<p>Well, when we have saved four and twenty pounds
of this kind of grease, and set aside six bushels of
ashes from what is known as hard wood, such as oak,
maple, or birch, we "set the leach."</p>

<p>I suppose every family in Boston has a leach-barrel,
which is a stout cask, perhaps one that has held pickled
pork or pickled beef, and has in it at the very bottom
a hole where is set a wooden spigot.</p>

<p>This barrel is placed upon some sort of platform
built to raise it sufficiently high from the
ground, so that a small tub or bucket may be put
under the spigot. Then it is filled with ashes, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
water poured into the top, which, of course, trickles
down until it runs, or, as some say, is leached, out
through the spigot, into the bucket, or whatsoever you
have put there to
receive it.</p>

<p>While running
slowly through the
ashes, it becomes
what is called lye,
and upon the making
of this lye depends
the quality
of the soap.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-131.jpg" width="290" height="282" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Now, of course,
as the water is poured upon the contents of the
barrel, the ashes settle down, and as fast as this
comes to pass, yet more ashes are added and more
water thrown in, until one has leached the entire
six bushels, when the lye should be strong enough, as
mother's receipt for soap-making has it, to "bear up an
egg, or a potato, so that you can see a portion of it on
the surface as big as a ninepence."</p>

<p>If the lye is not of sufficient strength to stand this
test, it must be ladled out and poured over the ashes
again, until finally, as will surely be the case, it has
become strong enough.</p>

<p>The next turn in the work is to build a fire out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
doors somewhere, because to make your soap in the
house would be a most disagreeable undertaking.
One needs a great pot, which should hold as much as
one-third of a barrel, and into this is poured half of
the grease and half of the lye, to be kept boiling until it
has become soap.</p>

<p>Now just when that point has been reached I cannot
say, because of not having had sufficient experience;
but mother is a master hand at this dirty labor, and
always has greatest success with it.</p>

<p>Of course, when one kettle-full has been boiled down,
the remainder of the lye and the remainder of the grease
is put in, and worked in the same manner as before.</p>

<h2>SOAP FROM BAYBERRIES</h2>

<p>It is possible, and we shall do so when time can be
spent in making luxuries, to get soap from the tallow
of bay berry plums.</p>

<p>I have already said that we stew out a kind of vegetable
tallow from bayberries with which to make candles,
and this same grease, when boiled with lye as if
you were making soft soap, can be cooked so stiff that,
when poured into molds, it will form little hard cakes
that are particularly convenient for the cleansing of
one's hands.</p>

<p>There can be no question but that bayberry soap
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
will whiten and soften the skin better than does soft
soap; but the labor of making it is so disagreeable
that, as Susan says, I had rather my hands were tough
and rough, than purchase a delicate skin at such an
expense.</p>

<h2>GOOSE-PICKING</h2>

<p>There is another household duty which frets me much,
and yet it must be performed, else would we be put to
it for quills with which to write, and for soft beds,
pillows, and quilts. It is goose-picking that I abhor,
not only because of its seeming extremely cruel, but on
account of its being like the soap-making, dirty work.</p>

<p>I question if there be a family in Boston who does not
own a flock of geese, and among them many who were
once wild. They wander around the streets all summer,
paddling the pools of water, chasing insects,
and devouring whatsoever may have been thrown out of
the houses that is eatable.</p>

<p>I doubt whether, if it were within the power of
our preachers so to do, they would not kill all the
geese in the town, for more than once on a Sabbath
day have these noisy creatures made such a tumult
outside the church that the sermon was actually interrupted.</p>

<p>Besides that, you cannot go anywhere without a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
lot of foolish geese running at your heels, hissing as if
you had done something for which you should be
ashamed, and they were calling attention to it.</p>
<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-134.jpg" width="254" height="363" alt="" />
</div>
<p>Twice each season, in the planting and the harvesting
time, must the small feathers be stripped from the
live birds, and while this is being done, the goose,
which has a strong neck and beak, would inflict many
a grievous wound if one did not pull an old stocking
over its head.</p>

<p>Some people are so particular as to have made goose
baskets, which in shape are not unlike small gourds, and
through the narrow neck of these the head of the goose
is thrust, while the body can be held firmly between the
knees of whosoever is
doing the plucking.</p>

<p>Of course, when one
is pulling feathers from
the bird, the fine fluff,
or down, flies everywhere
about like snow,
and the result is, that
unless you take the
precaution of tying
your hair up in cloths,
and putting on an old
linen dress from which
dirt can readily be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
shaken, you will be covered from head to foot with
these fluffy particles, which are not much larger than
snow-flakes, and extremely difficult to remove.</p>

<p>I have been so busy setting down matters concerning
the household, as to forget that I should tell you
how our town of Boston has grown, and who of the
great men of England have come into it.</p>

<h2>A CHANGE OF GOVERNORS</h2>

<p>It was the third year after our coming, that Master
John Cotton, the famous preacher, settled among us,
taking upon himself, because of the entreaties of our
people, the care of the First Church.</p>

<p>It was also in this same year that a new governor
was chosen, much to the regret of both Susan and me,
for while we girls could not be expected to know anything
regarding the matter, it surely seemed to us that
Master Winthrop was the very best man in all this
world to rule over us.</p>

<p>But those who had the privilege of voting must have
believed otherwise, for they elected Master Thomas
Dudley in his stead, and made Master Winthrop one
of the assistants in the Council.</p>

<p>With the exception of that, and the trouble which
Master Roger Williams, the great preacher, was making,
nothing disturbed us. Our town continued to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
grow fast, until we began to believe that before many
years had passed it would be even as great a city as
could be found in England, with, of course, the exception
of London.</p>

<h2>THE FLIGHT OF ROGER WILLIAMS</h2>

<p>Now as to the trouble which some of our people
were having with Master Roger Williams: I should be
able to set it down plainly, and yet it is not reasonable
to suppose girls know much about the affairs of state.</p>

<p>A very great preacher was Master Williams, and one
who took it upon himself to write, for the public reading,
that the King had no right to sell or give land to us
white people, because of the whole country's belonging
to the Indians, and it can be well understood how
much of a stir the matter caused.</p>

<p>Master Williams had been chosen by the people of
Salem as teacher in their church, and when he declared
that we had no right to hold the land which the
King had granted us, which Master Blackstone had sold
to us, and which Chickatabut had given to us in writing,
the chief men of our town declared that he was not
the kind of preacher who should be allowed to remain
in the New World. Therefore they wrote to the
people of Salem, demanding that he be sent back to
England.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span></p>

<p>Of course our gentlemen of Boston must have been
in the right, for I have heard my father say they were,
and surely he would not lend his face to anything which
was at all wrong. However, the people of Salem refused
to listen to us of Boston, and, much to our surprise,
Master John Cotton took sides with Master
Williams, which seemed to me very strange.</p>

<p>I cannot say why it was that the people of the colony
kept Governor Dudley in office only one year, or why
Master Haynes was elected.</p>

<p>Master Haynes was, of course, ruler over the entire
colony, and, as father said, not the kind of man to be
trifled with by Master Williams, even though he was a
preacher. Therefore, when Captain Underhill was
about to sail for
England, our Governor
commanded
him to take Master
Williams back to
London.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-137.jpg" width="294" height="326" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Some one, it
seems, told the
preacher what was
on foot, and, although
it was in
January with the
snow piled deep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
everywhere around, he fled from Salem into the woods,
trusting himself to the mercy of the savages rather
than be sent back in disgrace.</p>

<p>I have heard that it was a bitterly cold day, with the
snow blowing furiously, when the poor man plunged
into the woods in flight, taking with him nothing whatsoever
save that which he wore upon his back.</p>

<p>Father came to know afterward, that Master Williams
spent the winter with the Pokanoket Indians, some of
whom he had met during the short time he lived at
Plymouth, and in the spring went to the shore of
Narragansett Bay, where it was reported that he was
trying to build up a village.</p>

<h2>SIR HARRY VANE</h2>

<p>Quite the most distinguished person who came
among us was Sir Harry Vane. His father was a
Privy Councilor to the King, and one of the Secretaries
of State in England. Because of wanting to see the
New World, the young gentleman had been given
permission to come to this country for a term of three
years.</p>

<p>I wish you could have seen the stir that was made
when he arrived. The Governor, with his soldiers
and trumpeters, went down to the wharf to receive
him with great ceremony, and the cannon on board
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
the ships were discharged with a wondrous noise when
he stepped ashore.</p>

<p>He was a most pleasing man to look upon, so young
and so courtly, while his costume was a marvel of elegance.
It seemed to me, as I saw him taking the
Governor's hand with so much grace, that we needed
but few men of the same kind among us to lend great
distinction to our town in America.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-139.jpg" width="467" height="387" alt="" />
</div>

<p>That same evening, however, my mother reproached
me because of worldly thoughts, saying that fine
feathers do not make fine birds, although they may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
make a bird look fine, which I suppose is the same as
if she had said that an evil man might, by his costume,
be made to appear worthy, whereas he would not be so
at heart.</p>

<p>However, I was not the only one in Boston who
favored Sir Harry Vane, for before the year was over,
when Master Haynes' term of office had expired, he
was chosen as our Governor, and surely no person could
have looked more kingly than did he, when he stood
in the door of the Great House bowing to those people
who had assembled in honor of his having been elected.</p>

<h2>MAKING SUGAR</h2>

<p>Susan and I had a right delightful time when the
first warm days of spring came, for then it was the
season in which to make sugar. I do not mean to say
that we girls took any part in the sweet work; but on a
certain day, very early in the morning, we were allowed
to go out to Master Winthrop's plantation in New
Town, there to see his people at the task, and, what
was far better, we remained until late at night.</p>

<p>It was the first time I had been away from home,
save to go over to Charlestown for a few hours, since
we came from England, and I enjoyed it all the more
because of its being something strange.</p>

<p>The snow was deep on the low-lying lands, therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
we wore snow-shoes, and you must know that
we girls can use those odd footings almost as well as
do the Indian children. It was a long walk to New
Town; but father went with us, his gun loaded heavily
in case we came across a hungry wolf, and so great
was the excitement of
going abroad after having
been kept in the
house, except on those
days when we went to
meeting or lecture, ever
since the winter began,
that we gave no heed
to fatigue.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-141.jpg" width="259" height="338" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It seems queer that
one can get sugar from
trees, and yet so we do
in this new country,
otherwise there would
be many times when we would not have sweet cake, for
vessels seldom arrive from England with stores at the
very moment when one is in need of this thing or that.</p>

<p>After we had arrived at Master Winthrop's plantation,
good Mistress Winthrop went with us girls to
see the sap drawn from the maples, and the three of us
rode on a sled hauled by one of the serving men, of
whom Master Winthrop has many.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span></p>

<p>Do you know how the sap is taken? Well, first a
hole is bored in the trunk of a tree, about as high from
the surface as will admit of placing a bucket beneath
it, and into this a small wooden spout, or spigot, is
driven. Beneath the spout is placed a bucket or tub,
and into this the sap, coaxed up from the roots by
the warmth of the sun, drops, or runs, very slowly.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-142.jpg" width="255" height="413" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Master Winthrop's
serving men made holes
in many trees, and then,
when the work had been
done, went about gathering
the sap out of the
buckets or tubs, into
casks, which were
hauled from place to
place on a sled, exactly
as Mistress Winthrop,
Susan and I had ridden.</p>

<p>As soon as a cask has been
filled, a huge fire is built
near at hand, and over it
is hung a large kettle, much
as if one were counting on making soap. In this
the sap is boiled until it is thick, like molasses, in
case one wishes to make syrup, or yet longer if sugar
is wanted.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span></p>

<p>Of course it is necessary to taste of the syrup very
often to learn if it has been cooked enough, and this
portion of the work Susan and I did until we felt much
as flies look after they have been feasting on molasses,
and have their wings and legs clogged with sweetness.</p>

<p>I do not mean to say that we besmeared ourselves
with it; but we ate so much while tasting to learn if the
cooking was going on properly, that I felt as if I had
been turned into a big cake of sugar.</p>

<p>When the sap is thick enough to "sugar," as it is
called, it is poured into pans of birch-bark, where
it cools in cakes, each weighing two or three pounds.</p>

<h2>A "SUGARING DINNER"</h2>

<p>We enjoyed ourselves hugely until well after noon,
when we were so weary and sticky that it was a
positive relief to hear Mistress Winthrop propose that
we go back to her dwelling, and there what do you
think we found?</p>

<p>No less than twenty people from Boston, among
whom were Susan's mother and mine, had all come
out for what is called the "sugaring dinner."</p>

<p>Master Cotton, the preacher, was with the company,
and he made a most beautiful prayer while we were
waiting for the meal to be served, after which the
spirit moved him to ask at great length, and in a most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
touching manner, that the food might be blessed to
each and every one of us.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-144.jpg" width="285" height="329" alt="" />
</div>

<p>One could never have believed that we who were
gathered around the table ever had known what it
was to be painfully
hungry during one
entire winter, for
there was sufficient
of food to have
served us, in the old
days, a full week.</p>

<p>There were two
enormous wild turkeys
roasted to a
most delicious crispness,
one placed at
either end of the
table, while the handsomest standing salt I ever saw
was exactly in the center, so that no one could say
whether he was seated above or below the salt.</p>

<p>There were also two huge venison pies, with the
pastry made wholly of wheat flour; and placed around
the pies in a most tasteful manner, were potted pigeons,
in small dishes. There were apple and pear tarts;
marmalade and preserved plums, grapes, barberries
and cherries, together with poppy and cherry water,
cordial and mint water.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span></p>

<p>It was a most delicate feast, and my greatest regret
was that I had tasted so often of the maple sap I could
not do full justice to it. Tears actually stood in Susan's
eyes as she whispered to me after the dinner was come
to an end, and we were allowed to talk with each other,</p>

<p>"I shall never live long enough to cease being sorry
because I could not eat more."</p>

<p>It was the same as if she had confessed to the sin of
gluttony, and it was my duty to reprove her; but I
could not find it in my heart so to do, because of
much the same thought's being in my own mind.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-145.jpg" width="454" height="324" alt="" />
</div>

<p>We all sang psalms until near to seven o'clock in the
evening, when good Master Winthrop gave us a famous
ride on his new sled drawn by two oxen, and thus did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
we go home like really fashionable folk, who must
needs turn night into day, as my mother declared.</p>

<h2>TRAINING DAY</h2>

<p>I must tell you of our Training Day, in the month of
May, after Master Roger Williams had fled into the
wilderness to escape the wrath of our people which
he had aroused; and I am setting down what happened
on that particular day, because of its being the largest
and most exciting training ever held in Boston, so every
one says.</p>

<p>Susan believes Training Day should come oftener
than four times a year, so that we young people may
get some idea of what gay life is like in the old countries,
where they make festivals of Christmas, and other
saints' days. It does truly seem as if we might see
our soldiers perform quite often, for it is a most inspiring
spectacle, and especially was it on last Training
Day, when, so father says, there were upwards of seven
hundred men marching back and forth across the
Common in a manner which at times was really terrifying,
because of their fierce appearance when fully
armed.</p>

<p>Imagine, if you can, a row of booths along the Common,
in which are for sale ground nuts, packages of
nookick, sweet cakes, pumpkin bread roasted brown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
and spread with syrup made from maple sap, together
with dainties of all kinds lately brought over
from England.</p>

<p>Between these booths and the water are many tents,
which have been set up that the people of quality may
entertain their friends therein with toothsome food and
sweet waters.</p>

<p>The middle of the Common, and a long space at
either end, is kept clear of idle ones that the soldiers
may exercise at arms, and these do not appear until
the on-lookers are in their places. Then we hear a
flourish of trumpets, the rolling of drums, and from
the direction of the Neck comes our army, a mighty
array of seven hundred or more men, all armed and
equipped as the law directs.</p>

<p>When this vast body of warlike men have marched
into the vacant space, they are drawn up in line, there
is another flourish of trumpets, together with the rolling
of drums, and Master Cotton comes out from the tent
which has been set up for the use of the Governor and
his assistants, to offer a prayer.</p>

<p>On this day, moved by the sight of the great throng,
Master Cotton prayed long and fervently, whereat
some of the younger soldiers, having not the fear of
God in their hearts, pulled long faces one to another,
or shifted about uneasily on their feet, as if weary with
long standing, and I trembled lest the Governor, seeing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
such levity, might rebuke them openly, which would
be a great disgrace at such a time.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-148.jpg" width="469" height="416" alt="" />
</div>

<p>When Master Cotton was done with praying, the
soldiers began to march here and there in many ways,
until one's eyes were confused with watching them,
and then came the volleys, as the men shot straight
over the heads of the people; but father says no one
need fear such warlike work, for there were no bullets
in the guns.</p>

<p>Of course I understood that he must needs know
whether this be true or not, else he would not have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
spoken it; and yet I could not but shudder when so
many guns were fired at one time, while the smoke of
powder in the air was most painful to the eyes.</p>

<p>After the soldiers had marched back and forth in the
most ferocious manner possible until noon, they were
allowed a time for rest, and then it was that those who
had set up tents, entertained their friends at table
with stores upon stores of dainties of every kind.</p>

<h2>SHOOTING FOR A PRIZE</h2>

<p>I have heard that Sir Harry Vane declared our
soldiers presented a very fine front, whatever that may
be, and he is not backward about saying that even the
King himself has no more warlike appearing men in his
army. All of which is surely true, for Sir Harry, being
the son of a Privy Councilor, must have seen His
Majesty's troops many a time.</p>

<p>After all the people had feasted, each in his own
fashion, and the soldiers had been refreshed at the expense
of the town, the marching was begun again, to
be continued in a manner like to make one's head
swim, until the Governor gave the signal that the shooting
at a target might commence, when it was that the
guns were loaded with real bullets.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-150.jpg" width="292" height="398" alt="" />
</div>

<p>On this day it was Sir Harry who gave the prize to
be shot for, which was a doublet of velvet trimmed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
with lace, the value of which, so father declares, is not
less than five times as great as any prize that has ever
been offered on Training Day in Boston.</p>

<p>Susan and I were eager to know who won it; but before
the matter was settled, my mother insisted it was
time for us to go home, because of the behavior of
some of the soldiers' being none of the best after they
have done with the training.</p>

<p>However, we saw the doublet, and marked well the
pattern of the lace,
therefore if the
winner wears it on
the street, there
will be no question
as to our knowing
it again.</p>

<p>The training was
a most enjoyable
spectacle, even
though Susan and
I were so frightened
at times that
it seemed as if our
hearts were really
in our mouths, and
when we followed mother home on that afternoon, it
was with the belief that our town of Boston, although
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
not as old as Jamestown, Plymouth or Salem, had
grown, both in numbers and fashion, far beyond any
other settlement in this New World.</p>

<h2>LECTURE DAY</h2>

<p>My mother believes it would be better if Training
Day were done away with entirely, for she says we
spend far too much time in the pursuit of frivolity,
when we have no less than one lecture day in each
week. It must be that she is in the right, for father
has much the same opinion, and declares a stop must
be put to so many lectures, which but gives a convenient
excuse for indolent people, who should be at
work on the plantations or in the houses, to go gadding
about the town.</p>

<p>You must know that Thursday is the day when we
listen to lectures by some of the preachers, or those among
the magistrates who have the gift of speech, and this has
been the custom since the first year we came here.</p>

<p>In the early days the lecture hour was in the forenoon;
but at the end of three years, after Boston was
become a town, those in authority over us passed a law
that the lecture should not begin until one of the clock
in the afternoon, and this was done in order that the
people might not have an excuse to spend the entire
day in idleness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span></p>

<p>I cannot see, however, that any more work is done
on Thursdays now than before the law was made, for as
soon as breakfast is finished and the houses have been
set in order, nearly every one walks on the streets, this
pleasure being forbidden on Sabbath days, until it is
time to gather at the church.</p>

<p>Our magistrates also tried to make the rule that no
minister, or other person, should lecture more often
than once in every two weeks, in order that we might
have less of such diversion; but no heed is given to
this law, for I myself have heard Master Cotton speak
to the people no less than twice on every Thursday,
and this in addition to lectures by other preachers.</p>

<p>If father were one of the magistrates, mother would
do all she might to have the hour of the meetings set
back to the morning, for she believes it is wrong to
make of the forenoon a time for the punishing of evil-doers,
as has come to be the custom.</p>

<h2>PUNISHMENT FOR EVIL-DOERS</h2>

<p>Now, when we go out to mingle with the people, it is
impossible not to stop here or there when one of the
constables is whipping an idle fellow through the
streets, laying the lashes on his bare back with such
force that the blood follows nearly every blow.</p>

<p>Then again, it is not often that one can pass the post
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
at the corner of Prison Lane, without seeing some
wrong-doer chained there as punishment for striking
one of the people, and the cage wherein are kept men
and women who have offended against the laws is
seldom empty on a Thursday.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i-153.jpg" width="292" height="278" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The prison itself is a dreary looking place, although
it is not quite so very different from the church, but
somehow its barred
windows make the
shivers run up and
down my back and
I always hurry past
it with as much
speed as possible.</p>

<p>Most likely there
are as many bad
people in the other
towns of this New
World, as in Boston; but it surely seems to Susan and
me as if we had among us all those in America who
delight in breaking the laws.</p>

<p>Of all the punishments which are inflicted here, I
think the most cruel is that of sentencing a man to
wear, so long as he may live, a halter around his neck
so that every one may see it, for thus is the wrong-doer
forced to shame himself during every hour of the day,
and especially on Thursdays, when he must stand not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
less than two hours during the forenoon on the steps
of the church.</p>

<p>It is on lecture day that one may see the latest notices
put up on the church, together with the announcements
of those who intend to be married, and Susan
and I have great pleasure in reading these, for then
are we aware of anything important about to take place.</p>

<p>Of course there are times when we are not so well
pleased at being forced to sit still five or six long hours,
listening to this preacher or that who feels a call to
speak during the lecture time; but if we failed to do so,
we should not be allowed to go on the street wheresoever
we please, therefore I hope that mother will not be able
to have the lecture hour changed to the morning.</p>

<h2>THE MURDER OF JOHN OLDHAM</h2>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i-154.jpg" width="289" height="215" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It was six years after we had come to live in Boston,
that a most terrible crime was committed by the savages
of the Narragansett
tribe, for then
they killed Captain
John Oldham, and
three other men,
who were sailing
on Long Island
Sound. The vessel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
was taken by the Indians, after they had murdered all
on board, and we in Boston were moved to great fear,
believing the brown men around us were making ready
to murder the white people.</p>

<p>Sir Harry Vane, the Governor, sent five of our chief
men to the head savage of the Narragansett tribe, to
inquire into the matter, and these messengers were told
that none save the Indians living on Block Island
had any hand in the matter.</p>

<p>Then it was that Governor Vane commanded Master
Endicott of Salem, to take a large number of fighting
men in three vessels, and punish the murderers as they
deserved.</p>

<p>Master Endicott did according to the command;
but when he was come to Block Island, the brown
people had run away; therefore all he could do
was to burn the huts, destroy the canoes, and shoot
the dogs that were prowling around the deserted village.</p>

<p>This Master Endicott did not believe was punishment
enough for what had been done, therefore he
crossed over to the mainland where the Indians who
call themselves Pequots live, and there he killed more
than twenty of these people, besides seizing their corn.
He also burned, or destroyed in some other way, all
the goods belonging to the savages that he could find,
and then came back to Boston, where the people of the
town turned out to give him a noble welcome.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span></p>

<p>We had a thanksgiving day because of what had been
done, and believed, or, at least, Susan and I did, that
we need fear nothing more from the savages, for surely
the brown people would not dare molest any white
man again after being so severely punished.</p>

<h2>SAVAGES ON THE WAR-PATH</h2>

<p>It was not many days, however, before word was
brought to Boston that the Pequot Indians were trying
to coax the Narragansett savages to join them in killing
every Englishman that could be found in the
land.</p>

<p>Father had said that this might be done, if the brown
people all over the country should come together, and
we who lived in Boston and Salem were in great fear.</p>

<p>The soldiers were called together from every village.
The gates of the fort on the Neck were kept closed,
with men stationed there night and day to see that no
enemy came through, and the preachers prayed most
fervently that our lives might be spared because of our
doing our utmost to serve God as He would have us.</p>

<p>Then it was that the Lord heard our prayers, else had
we all been killed, and it was brought about in a way
such as, my mother said, heaped coals of fire upon our
heads.</p>

<p>The same Master Roger Williams who had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
driven out into the wilderness, because of holding a
belief contrary to ours, and who had lived with the
Narragansett Indians since then, so pleaded with the
savages of the tribe that they sent some of their chief
people to Boston, with promises of friendliness.</p>

<p>Sir Harry Vane received the visitors with great state.
All our soldiers were paraded through the streets, and
in front of the Governor's house. The drummers
marched to and fro making music, and the people came
out on the streets that the Indians might believe we had
not been afraid.</p>

</div>

<p>It was much like Training Day, save that only the
magistrates of the town were allowed to know what
was being done in the Governor's house after the savages
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
had gone into the building, decked out in a brave array
of feathers, and in clothing embroidered with fanciful
colored quills of porcupines, and with their faces painted
in a most hideous fashion.</p>

<p>We were told, after the Indians had marched out of
the town, near to sunset, one behind the other in a
manner as solemn as if they were coming from church,
that the tribe of Narragansett savages had promised
to aid us white people against the brown men of the
Pequot tribe, in every way possible, and greatly did we
rejoice that night, for it seemed as if all trouble had
passed.</p>

<h2>PEQUOT INDIANS</h2>

<p>The Englishmen who had settled in the colony known
as Connecticut, soon found that the Pequot savages
could do much of wickedness, even though the Narragansetts
had said they would be friends with the white
people, for within a very short time after Master Roger
Williams had sent the Indians to us in peace, did a
season of murder begin.</p>

<p>Because of my being a girl, who is not supposed to
understand affairs of state, and who could only cower
in fear and trembling by the side of her mother when
word was brought of the dreadful deeds done by the
Pequot savages, I shall not set down anything whatsoever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
concerning that terrible winter, when we heard
nothing save stories of blood and direst suffering.</p>

<p>No one could say whether, despite all Master Roger
Williams might be able to do, the savages nearabout
would not fall upon us of Boston as they had upon the
white people of Connecticut, and, therefore, as soon as
the shadows of evening had begun to gather, we girls
sought the protection of our mothers.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i-159.jpg" width="458" height="383" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Seated before the roaring fires, not daring to move
about the house even after the doors and shutters were
securely barred, we started in alarm at every sound,
hearing in the roaring of the wind, or the crackling of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
the fire, some token that the brown people were skulking
around striving to get inside that they might shed
our blood.</p>

<p>It was far worse than the time of the famine, for
then we knew just what might come to us, and if death
entered the house, we would meet it in the arms of those
we loved; but from all which had been told by those
affrighted people who came to us from Connecticut,
we realized that horrors such as could not even be imagined,
would be upon us with the coming of those
savages who had sworn to make an end of the white
settlers in the New World.</p>

<p>It is not well even that I set down in words the distress
of mind which was ours during that long dreadful
winter; but this I may say in all truth, as the parting
word, that nowhere in the Massachusetts Bay Colony
could have been found a more distressed or unhappy
girl, than this same Ruth of Boston.</p>
